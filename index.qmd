# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a book contains R code and examples for addressing tasks faced by the Bibliometrics Team at the University of Southampton Library Service.

If you want a full guide to data analysis in R check out [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)

Some of the materials here are re-used from previous workshops I ran for biologists from 2019/20 called [Coding Together](https://ab604.github.io/docs/coding-together-2019/).

If you are new to R, then the first thing to know is that R is a programming language and RStudio is program for working with R called an integrated development environment (IDE). You can use R without RStudio, but not the other way around.

### Guiding principles

Keep the raw data raw

Write love letters to our future selves.
