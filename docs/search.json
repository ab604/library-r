    "text": "Note 1.1: Is programming hard to learn?\n\n\n\n“…programming in general…is primarily about learning to think a certain way - to decompose a problem into very simple steps each of which can be easily solved. Some people have an affinity to this – they will pick it up faster, while others will need more practice.”\nSource: The Biostar Handbook\n\n\n\n1.1.1 But why is it worth doing?\n\nMaybe it isn’t, but experience is one way to find out.\nMy experience is that in the long term, it saves me time and frees up time from doing boring repetitive tasks for doing more interesting and more complex things.\n\n\n\n1.1.2 What are we doing?\nFigure 1.1 shows a version of the data science cycle from R4DS. Conceptually, this is what we are mostly doing. In R4DS, all of these steps are done programmatically, but we won’t be trying to do everything here.\nModeling is beyond our scope here, but you may wish to explore the modeling part of the cycle yourself. For example, check out Tidy Modeling with R.\nAs a librarian, your data is likely to be in a spreadsheet. We need to learn how to import that data into an environment where we can work with it and explore questions.\nIn asking and answering those questions we need to learn to transform data and/or visualise our data.\nWe then need to communicate our findings back out of our working environment to our colleagues or for our own records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: A version of the data science cycle from R4DS. We will cover data importing, tidying, transformation and visualisation, but not modeling. Communication of your output is the final part of the workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 How are we going to do it?\nAs per Note 1.1, step-by-step and through practice we will learn to think and work in a certain way that may be different to how you have previously worked.\nIt may seem all a bit abstract to begin with, but that is part of the point. In learning to generalise from abstractions, one can identify and apply the same concepts to lots of specific problems that may at first seem different, but are either the same or similar.\nOur guiding principles in doing this are:\n\nKeep the raw data raw.\nWrite love letters to our future selves in the form of our code and how we organise and document our data.",

Perhaps the biggest conceptual difference is that in Excel one is programming with the raw data - which conflicts with the guiding principles of keeping the raw data separate from the code (Section 1.1.3).\nWith most languages, the file(s) holding the data are separate from the file(s) that contains the code.\nOn the one hand programming with the raw data makes it easy to get started in Excel, but on the other hand it gets harder as the complexity of what you are trying to do increases.\nAnd vice versa.\nIn other languages getting started is harder, but it’s easier to do more complex tasks once some initial learning is done.\nIt’s really a question of whether it’s worth the investment learning R, python etc. Hence my comments in Section 1.1.1.",

    "text": "3.2 What is RStudio?\nR is the language and RStudio is software created to facilitate our use of R. They are installed separately. You don’t need RStudio to use R, but you do need R to used RStudio.\nRStudio is an interactive development environment (IDE). It can be used to write code, navigate the files found on our computer, inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots. RStudio can also be used for other languages and other tasks (e.g., version control, developing packages, writing Shiny apps) that are beyond the scope here.\nFigure 3.1 shows the default view of the RStudio. It is divided into “Panes”.\nWhen you first open RStudio, there are three panes,the console where you type commands, your environment/history (top-right), and your files/plots/packages/help/viewer (bottom-right).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: RStudio is an interactive development environment (IDE). This the default view of the R console, environment and output panes. These can be rearranged as desired.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe environment shows all the R objects you have created or are using, such as data you have imported.\nThe output pane can be used to view any plots you have created.\nNot opened at first start up is the fourth default pane: the script editor pane, but this will open as soon as we create/edit a R script (or many other document types). The script editor is where will be typing much of the time.\nThe placement of these panes and their content can be customized (see menu, R Studio -&gt; Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Pane Layout). One of the advantages of using R Studio is that all the information you need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally, with many short-cuts, auto-completion, and highlighting for the major file types you use while developing in R, R Studio will make typing easier and less error-prone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShortcuts\n\n\n\nRStudio has lots of keyboard shortcuts to make coding quicker and easier. Try to find the menu listing all the keyboard shortcuts, including the short-cut to find the menu!\n\n\nTime for another philosophical diversion…\n\n3.2.1 What is real?\nAt the start, we might consider our environment “real”, that is to say the objects we’ve created/loaded and are using are “real”.\nBut it’s much better in the long run to consider our scripts as “real”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur scripts are where we write down the code that creates our objects that we’ll be using in our environment.\nAs a script is a document, it is reproducible.\n\n\n\nOr to put it another way: we can easily recreate an environment from our scripts, but not so easily create a script from an environment.\nTo support the notion of thinking in terms of our scripts as real, it is recommended to turn off the preservation of workspaces between sessions by setting the Tools &gt; Global Options menu in R studio as shown in Figure 3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: It is recommended to turn off the preservation of workspaces between sessions by setting Save workspace to .RData on exit to Never\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Where am I?\nThe part of your computer operating system that manages files and directories (aka folders) is called the file system. This dates back to 1969 and the Unix filesystem.\nThe idea is that we have a rooted tree, as with phylogenetic rooted trees in biology. From the root all other directories and files exist along paths going back to the root as shown in Figure 3.3.\nOn Unix based systems such as Apple or Android, the root is denoted with a forward slash /. On Windows the root is a back slash \\. The / or \\ is used to to separate directories along the path, denoting a change in the level of the tree\nNote: in RStudio the path separator and root is always / regardless of the operating system.\n\n3.2.2.1 Absolute path from the root /\nFigure 3.3 shows the absolute path from the root to folder H as a red line.\nThis is just a made-up example, but in text in this would be /B/E/H.\nOn a Windows machine the root path may start with the hard drive name e.g. C:/ and on an Apple or Linux machine it will just begin /.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: The absolute path from the root / through sub-folders B and E to folder H is shown by the red line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the R console, the function getwd() will show your current working directory as an absolute path from the root.\nThe path is also shown at the top of the R console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Relative path from where you are\nWe can also consider relative paths, paths that are relative to each file or folder rather than the root.\nImagine I have project called penguin-project and I have a script in the R folder that analyses data in a spreadsheet in the data folder.\nFigure 3.4 shows the relative path between analysis-2024-02-27.R and the spreadsheet survey-2024-02-27.csv.\nIn natural language from the R script to access the spreadsheet we would need to “go up from the R directory to the project directory and then back down into the data directory”.\nIn machine readable language from our R script the relative path would be written as ../data/survey-2024-02-27.csv where ../ means go up one level from where the script is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: The relative path between the R script analysis-2024-02-27.R in the R folder and the and the spreadsheet survey-2024-02-27.csv used by the R script in the data folder is shown in red.",

Functions in R have the syntax of the name of the function followed by round brackets. The round brackets are where we type the arguments that the function requires to carry out its task. For example, in Section 3.3 the function install.packages() requires the name of the package we want to install as arguments.\nMany, if not most, functions can take more than one argument. The creators of the function should have given these defaults for the situation where the user provides only one or some arguments. RStudio should prompt you for the arguments as you type, but if you need to see what they are, use the help function ? with the function name in the Console and it will open the help panel or type the function name into the help panel search box.\nFor example, to find out all the arguments for install.packages() we’d type ?install.packages and press Enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry installing the cowsay package\n\n\n\nInstall and load cowsay with the install.packages() and library() functions. cowsay has one function called say() that you can use to create messages with animals.\n\n\n\n ----- \nUse ?say to open the help\ndocumentation for the say() function. \n ------ \n    \\   ^__^ \n     \\  (oo)\\ ________ \n        (__)\\         )\\ /\\ \n             ||------w|\n             ||      ||\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Introducing the Palmer Penguins\nThe Palmer Penguins package is a dataset curated by Allison Horst of data on three penguin species from the Palmer Station in Antarctica (Figure 3.5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Hex sticker of the Palmer Penguins package curated by Allison Horst showing the Chinstrap, Gentoo and Adélie penguins.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a great dataset for getting started with and you can install it like so:\n\ninstall.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\n\nThe three penguins species are the Chinstrap, Gentoo and Adélie penguins (Figure 3.6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Artwork by @allison_horst of the Chinstrap, Gentoo and Adélie penguins.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset records various information about 344 penguins, including their culmen (Figure 3.7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Artwork by @allison_horst of the culman of a Gentoo penguin.",

    "text": "3.5 A project orientated workflow\nThis section is all about how to use R and RStudio to “maximize effectiveness and reduce frustration.”\nThe above quote is from Jenny Bryan’s article about a project orientated workflow.\nThe main point here is that how you do things, the workflow, should not be mixed up with the product of the workflow itself.\nThe product being:\n\nthe raw data.\nthe code needed to produce the results from the raw data.\n\nWays in which you can mix workflow and product include having lines in your script that set your working directory, or using RStudio to save your environment when you are working.\nBut why is this a problem?\nIt’s because your computer isn’t my computer or my laptop isn’t my desktop or I’m now using a Windows machine and I wrote the code two years ago on a Mac.\nBy hard coding the directory into a script I have ensured my code will only run on the machine in which it was written. Chances are you will want to share your code with someone, either for publication or for them to check your work, or because you are working collaboratively and therefore we need to avoid mixing workflow with product.\nLikewise we can’t share environments directly, but we can share the code that creates the environment.\nIf we organise our analysis into self-contained projects that hold everything needed to perform the analysis. These projects can be shared across machines and the analysis recreated, and thus the workflow is kept separate from the product.\nWhat does this look like in practice?\n\n3.5.1 RStudio Projects\nStep one is to use an interactive development environment such as RStudio rather than using R on its own for your analysis.\nRStudio contains a facility to keep all files associated with a particular analysis together called, as you might expect from Section 3.5, a Project.\nCreating a Project creates a file .Rproj containing all the information associated with your analysis including the Project location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it), and optionally preserves custom settings and open files to make it easier to resume work after a break. This is also super helpful if you are working on multiple projects as you can switch between them at a click.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: Starting a new R project in RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\nThese the steps for creating an Project in a new folder:\n\nStart R Studio (presentation of R Studio -below- should happen here)\nUnder the File menu, click on New project, choose New directory, then Empty project\nEnter a name for this new folder (aka directory), and choose a convenient location for it. This will be your working directory for the project.\nClick on Create project\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Naming things\nJenny Bryan also has three principles for naming things that are well worth remembering.\nWhen you names something, a file or an object, ideally it should be:\n\nMachine readable (no white space, punctuation, upper and lower-case)\nHuman readable (makes sense in 6 months or 2 years time)\nPlays well with default ordering (numerical or date order)\n\nWe’ll see examples of this as we go along.",

It’s from these atoms that more complex structures are built. Atomic vectors have one dimension, just like a single row or a single column in a spreadsheet.\nThese are the building blocks of more complex data containers such as data frame (Section 3.10.3) containing the penguin dataset (Section 3.4.1).\nThe four main atoms of R are:\n\nDoubles: regular numbers, +ve or -ve and with or without decimal places. AKA numerics.\nIntegers: whole numbers, specified with an upper-case L, e.g. int &lt;- 2L\nCharacters: Strings of text\nLogicals: these store TRUE‘s and FALSE’s’ which are useful for comparisons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: The atomic R data types that form the building blocks of more complex data containers.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s make a character vector and check the atomic vector type, using the typeof(). This also introduces a very important R function c(). This lower case c stands for combine. So when we have several objects e.g. words or numbers, we can combine them into a vector the length of the number of objects, as illustrated here for a pack of cards:\n\ncards &lt;- c(\"ace\", \"king\", \"queen\", \"jack\", \"ten\")\n\ncards\n\n[1] \"ace\"   \"king\"  \"queen\" \"jack\"  \"ten\"  \n\ntypeof(cards)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nNote here that we see the use of the assignment operator &lt;- to assign our vector on the right as the object cards. We talk more about that in Section 3.9.\nAlso note that the output of typeof() is itself a vector of length one and type character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry creating a vector of integers\n\n\n\nUse the seq() function to create a vector of numbers from 1 to 10, and typeof() to examine the vector type.\nRemember to use ?seq if you want to learn more about the function.",

    "section": "3.9 Assigning objects",
    "text": "3.9 Assigning objects\nObjects are how we store data inside the R environment. We assign labels to objects using the assignment operator &lt;-\n\nmass_kg &lt;- 55\n\nRead this as “mass_kg is assigned to value 55” in your head. A subtle but important point here is that the object is 55 and the value remains 55 regardless of the label we assign to it.\nIn fact we could assign more than one label to the same object. Another way to think about this is that Bibi is a cat (Figure 3.11), and remains a cat even if I call her Pickle when she’s being naughty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.11: Bibi is of data type cat regardless of her name.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing &lt;- can be annoying to type, so use RStudio’s keyboard short cut: Alt + - (the minus sign) to make life easier.\nMany people ask why we use this assignment operator when we can use = instead?\nColin Fay had a Twitter thread on this subject, but the reason I favour most is that it provides clarity. The arrow points in the direction of the assignment (it is actually possible to assign in the other direction too) and it distinguishes between creating an object in the workspace and assigning a value inside a function.\nObject name style is a matter of choice, but must start with a letter and can only contain letters, numbers, _ and .. We recommend using descriptive names and using _ between words. Some special symbols cannot be used in variable names, so watch out for those.\nSo here we’ve used the name to indicate its value represents a mass in kilograms. Look in your environment pane and you’ll see the mass_kg object containing the (data) value 55.\nWe can inspect an object by typing it’s name:\n\nmass_kg\n\n[1] 55\n\n\nWhat’s wrong here?\n\nmass_KG\n\nError: object 'mass_KG' not found\nThis error illustrates that typos matter, everything must be precise and mass_KG is not the same as mass_kg. mass_KG doesn’t exist, hence the error.\nLet’s use seq() to create a sequence of numbers, and at the same time practice tab completion.\nStart typing se in the console and you should see a list of functions appear, add q to shorten the list, then use the up and down arrow to highlight the function of interest seq() and hit Tab to select. This is tab completion.\nRStudio puts the cursor between the parentheses to prompt us to enter some arguments. Here we’ll use 1 as the start and 10 as the end:\n\nseq(1,10)\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nIf we left off a parentheses to close the function, then when we hit enter we’ll see a + indicating RStudio is expecting further code. We either add the missing part or press Escape to cancel the code.\nLet’s call a function and make an assignment at the same time. Here we’ll use the base R function seq() which takes three arguments: from, to and by.\nRead the following code as “assign my_sequence to an object that stores a sequence of numbers from 2 to 20 by intervals of 2.\n\nmy_sequence &lt;- seq(2,20,2)\n\nThis time nothing was returned to the console, but we now have an object called my_sequence in our environment.\n\n3.9.1 Indexing and sub-setting\nIf we want to access and subset elements of my_sequence we use square brackets [] and the index number. Indexing in R starts at 1 such that 1 is the index of the first element in the sequence, element 1 having the the value of 2.\nFor example element five would be subset by:\n\nmy_sequence[5]\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nHere the number five is the index of the vector, not the value of the fifth element. The value of the fifth element is 10.\nAnd returning multiple elements uses a colon :, like so\n\nmy_sequence[5:8]\n\n[1] 10 12 14 16",

    "text": "3.10 Lists, matrices, arrays and data frames\nLists also group data into one dimensional sets of data. The difference being that list group objects instead of individual values, such as several atomic vectors.\nFor example, let’s make a list containing a vector of numbers and a character vector\n\nlist_1 &lt;- list(1:110,\"R\")\n\nlist_1\n\n[[1]]\n  [1]   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18\n [19]  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36\n [37]  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54\n [55]  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72\n [73]  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90\n [91]  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108\n[109] 109 110\n\n[[2]]\n[1] \"R\"\n\n\nNote the double brackets to indicate the list elements, i.e. element one is the vector of numbers and element two is a vector of a single character.\nWe won’t be working with lists, but they are a flexible way to store data of different types in R.\nAccessing list elements uses double square brackets syntax, for example list_1[[1]] would return the first vector in our list.\nAnd to access the first element in the first vector would combine double and single square brackets like so: list_1[[1]][1].\nDon’t worry if you find this confusing, everyone does when they first start with R. Hadley Wickham tweeted an image to illustrate list indexing shown in Figure 3.12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.12: List indexing by Hadley Wickham\n\n\n\n\n\nLists and NULL which indicates the absence of a vector, complete the set of base vectors in R as illustrated in Figure 3.13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.13: The base vectors of R includes Lists and NULL vectors in addition to the atomic vectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.10.1 Matrices and arrays\nAtomic vectors have one dimension, one row or one column. Matrices are an object type that store data of the same type in a two dimensional array like a table.\nWhereas arrays can have N dimensions, which makes them hard to imagine. We won’t be using these either, but they are also valid R objects\n\n\n3.10.2 Categorical data aka Factors\nFactors are Rs way of storing categorical information such as eye colour or car type. A factor is something that can only have certain values, and can be ordered (such as low,medium,high) or unordered such as types of fruit.\nFactors are useful as they code string variables such as “red” or “blue” to integer values e.g. 1 and 2, which can be used in statistical models and when plotting, but they are confusing as they look like strings.\nFactors look like strings, but behave like integers.\nHistorically R converts strings to factors when we load and create data, but it’s often not what we want as a default. Since R version 4.0.0 strings not treated as factors by default.\n\n\n3.10.3 Data frames\nFor data analysis in R, we mostly be using data frames.\nData frames are two dimensional versions of lists in that they can contain different data types in the same object (unlike matrices or arrays). This is form of storing data we are going to be using and is encountered day-to-day in the library.\nIn a data frame each atomic vector type becomes a column, and a data frame is formed by columns of vectors of the same length. Each column element must be of the same type, but the column types can vary.\nFigure 3.14 shows an example data frame we’ll refer to as saved as the object df consisting of three rows and three columns. Each column is a different atomic data type of the same length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.14: An example data frame df with three rows and three columns. The first column is a numeric vector, the second a character vector and the third a logical vector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(numeric_vector = c(1,7,3), \n                 character_vector = c(\"S\",\"A\",\"U\"),\n                 logical_vector = c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE), \n                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n\ndf\n\n  numeric_vector character_vector logical_vector\n1              1                S           TRUE\n2              7                A          FALSE\n3              3                U           TRUE\n\n\nPackages in the tidyverse create a modified form of data frame called a tibble. You can read about tibbles here.\nHere’s what the code to make the same data frame as before as a tibble looks like. Note how we get more information from a tibble when it is returned to the Console, it tells us what the dimensions are, and what type of vectors it contains.\nNote that I have to load the tibble package as it is not a base R function. Also note the difference in the way the information about df and tbl_df are displayed.\n\nlibrary(tibble)\n\ntbl_df &lt;- tibble(numeric_vector = c(1,7,3), \n                 character_vector = c(\"S\",\"A\",\"U\"),\n                 logical_vector = c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE))\n\ntbl_df\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  numeric_vector character_vector logical_vector\n           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;lgl&gt;         \n1              1 S                TRUE          \n2              7 A                FALSE         \n3              3 U                TRUE          \n\n\nSub-setting data frames can also be done with square bracket syntax, but as we have both rows and columns, we need to provide index values for both row and column.\nFor example df[1,2] means return the value of df row 1, column 2. This corresponds with the value A.\nWe can also use the colon operator to choose several rows or columns, and by leaving the row or column blank we return all rows or all columns.\n\n# Subset rows 1 and 2 of column 1\ndf[1:2,1]\n\n[1] 1 7\n\n# Subset all rows of column 3\ndf[,3]\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nDon’t worry too much about this for now, we won’t be doing this, but it’s worth being aware of this syntax.",

    "text": "3.11 Plotting and exporting data\nOne of the most useful and important parts of any data analysis is plotting data and Chapter 7 goes into detail. But to give you an example, we’ll use the ggplot2 package as an introduction to automating a task in code, and as a tool for understanding data.\nggplot2 implements the grammar of graphics, for describing and building graphs. The idea being that we construct a plot in the following way:\n\nCall the ggplot() function to create a graph.\nPass our data as the first argument to the ggplot() function.\nThen pass some arguments to the aesthetics function aes() inside the gpplot() which tell ggplot how to plot the data e.g. which data goes on the x and y axis.\nThen we follow the ggplot function with a + sign to indicate we are going to add more code, followed by a geometric object function, a geom which maps the data to type of plot we want to make e.g. a histogram or scatter plot.\n\nDon’t worry if this sounds confusing, it becomes clear with practice and all plots follow this grammar.\nWe’ll use the pengiuns from the Palmer Penguins (Section 3.4.1) dataset to the question what is the relationship between body mass and flipper length?\nTry ?penguins to learn more about the data.\n\nPenguin mass in grams is in the body_mass_g column.\nFlipper length is in the flipper_length_mm column.\n\nTo create a plot of penguin mass body_mass_g (x-axis) against flipper length flipper_length_mm (y-axis) we do the following:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm))\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning messages\n\n\n\nWhen we created the plot we got a message:\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values ('geom_point()').\nThis is telling us that two rows have missing values for either the flipper length or body mass and therefore couldn’t be plotted.\nR and ggplot2 give us warnings like this to help us stop and think. This time we can safely ignore the warning, but in general we should investigate and document our choices.\n\n\nOur initial plot shows as we might expect, bigger penguins have bigger flippers.\nNow try extending this code to include to add a colour aesthetic to the the aes() function, let colour = species, so we can see the different sizes of the penguin species.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggplot(data = penguins) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, \n                           colour = species))\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can see that in addition to the relationship betweeen body mass and flipper length, that Adélie and Chinstrap penguins are approximately the same in mass and flipper length, whilst Gentoo penguins are generally heavier with bigger flippers..\nCheck out the ggplot2 documentation for all the aesthetic possibilities (and Google for examples).\nSo now we have re-usable code snippet for generating plots in R:\n\nggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;) + \n  &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;(mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;))\n\nConcretely, in our first example &lt;DATA&gt; was penguins, the &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt; was geom_point() and the arguments we supplies to map our aesthetics &lt;MAPPINGS&gt; were x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm.\nAs we can use this code for any tidy data set, hopefully you are beginning to see how a small amount of code can do a lot.",

This creates a table in comma separated variable format that can opened by spreadsheet software such as excel.\nAs it is a function is has round brackets and the main arguments we pass are the object containing the data we want to output and the name of the file and the location we want to write the file to, in this case the outputs folder.\nI’m also going to use the glue package and glue() function combined with base R function Sys.Date() to create a filename which is a character vector using today’s date.\nSo the syntax here is of one function nested inside another function: write_excel_csv(&lt;data&gt;, glue(&lt;output-file&gt;)) and glue() has a third function Sys.Date() called from within it too. So it’s a bit confusing at first.\n\nlibrary(glue)\n# Write csv file to outputs folder with today's date\nwrite_excel_csv(penguins, \n                glue(\"outputs/penguin-data-{Sys.Date()}.csv\")\n                )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nglue evaluation\n\n\n\nWe’ve not seen this syntax before, but glue is a tidyverse package for working with strings.\nUsing curly brackets {} the glue() function will paste together and evaluate values from R objects with strings of characters.\nThis has lots of uses, but to aid your understanding here’s an example where I create two single value vectors, one character and the other integer for Bibi the cat and then use glue to insert them into a sentence.\n\nlibrary(glue)\nname &lt;- \"Bibi\"\nage &lt;- 11\n\nglue(\"My neighbour's cat is called {name} and this year she \n     will be {age+1} years old.\")\n\nMy neighbour's cat is called Bibi and this year she \nwill be 12 years old.\n\n\nNote that glue evaluates the expression age+1.\n\n\nHere we are writing the penguins data frame as a csv file to the outputs folder and a file called outputs/penguin-data-2024-03-12.csv. The date in the filename is the date I built this book (2024-03-12)\n\n\n3.12.2 ggsave\nIf we want to save the last plot we made in ggplot2 we can use the ggsave() function.\nWe tell ggsave() the filename, and it will save it as that type depending on how we name the file. For example if we use file.png it will save a png and if we use file.jpeg it will save a jpeg.\nCheck out ?ggsave or the link above for more arguments we can supply to ggsave(), such as plot width and height, resolution or background colour.\nTo save our last plot for example using glue() again to automatically provide the date.\n\nggsave(\n  glue(\"outputs/penguins-mass-vs-flipper-plot-{Sys.Date()}.png\")\n  )",

    "text": "4.4 The four most common dplyr verbs\nWe’ll use the four most common verbs in dplyr to examine the Palmer Penguins data (Section 3.4.1).\n\n4.4.1 Filter rows with filter()\nTo remind you, the penguins data frame has 344 rows (Section 3.4.1). Each row contains a set of observations contained in the columns for a single penguin from one of three species (Figure 3.6) living on one of three islands.\nSo if for example we wanted to filter the data frame for only the rows of penguins with a bills longer or equal to 50 mm, we would use the filter function as shown in Figure 4.3.\nThe function takes the penguins data frame object as the first argument. Either within the parentheses or via a pipe.\nThe second argument is the column (variable) we wish to filter on, in this case bill_length_mm and a logical expression (evaluates as TRUE or FALSE) that is the filter.\nHere the expression is greater or equal to 50 &gt;= 50.\nSo any row with a value in bill_length_mm greater or equal to 50 is TRUE and is retained and any row with a value less than 50 is FALSE and is discarded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: The dplyr filter function. The filter function returns rows from your data frame that satisfy your filter expression as TRUE. Here it will return all Palmer Penguins with a bill longer or equal to 50 mm. Here it shows how filter will return all Palmer Penguins with a bill longer or equal to 50 mm. The function can either be used by providing the penguins data.frame as the first argument to the function or by passing the penguins data frame via a pipe.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the code, note that I’ve piped the output to the dplyr glimpse() function which prints a transposed summary of the filtered data frame contents to the console.\nInstead of a table of 344 penguins, we’ve returned a data frame with the 57 penguins (rows) that have bills equal or longer than 50 mm, but we still have 8 columns (variables) as filter() only acts on the rows.\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  filter(bill_length_mm &gt;= 50) |&gt; \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 57\nColumns: 8\n$ species           &lt;fct&gt; Gentoo, Gentoo, Gentoo, Gentoo, Gentoo, Gentoo, Gent…\n$ island            &lt;fct&gt; Biscoe, Biscoe, Biscoe, Biscoe, Biscoe, Biscoe, Bisc…\n$ bill_length_mm    &lt;dbl&gt; 50.0, 50.0, 50.2, 50.0, 59.6, 50.5, 50.5, 50.1, 50.4…\n$ bill_depth_mm     &lt;dbl&gt; 16.3, 15.2, 14.3, 15.3, 17.0, 15.9, 15.9, 15.0, 15.3…\n$ flipper_length_mm &lt;int&gt; 230, 218, 218, 220, 230, 222, 225, 225, 224, 231, 22…\n$ body_mass_g       &lt;int&gt; 5700, 5700, 5700, 5550, 6050, 5550, 5400, 5000, 5550…\n$ sex               &lt;fct&gt; male, male, male, male, male, male, male, male, male…\n$ year              &lt;int&gt; 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2008, 2008, 2008, 2008…\n\n\nFiltering can be done using multiple columns and expressions. See the official filter documentation for more complex examples.\n\n\n4.4.2 Arranging rows with arrange()\nAnother row verb is arrange() which as the name suggests arranges the rows according to column values (Figure 4.4 ).\nHere I’ll pipe the penguins data frame to the base R head() function, which returns the first six rows by default. Again I am returning the output to the console.\nI’ve formatted the output slightly here to highlight flipper_length_mm in red, so it may look a bit different to your output. We can see that row four is one of the two rows with missing values (indicated by NA) that we first encountered as a warning when we plotted this data (Section 3.11).\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  head() \n\n\n\nspeciesislandbill_length_mmbill_depth_mmflipper_length_mmbody_mass_gsexyearAdelieTorgersen3911871813750male2007AdelieTorgersen3951741863800female2007AdelieTorgersen4031801953250female2007AdelieTorgersenNANANANANA2007AdelieTorgersen3671931933450female2007AdelieTorgersen3932061903650male2007\n\n\nNext I add another line of code using arrange(flipper_length_mm) to sort the rows according to the values in this column. It defaults to ascending order.\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  arrange(flipper_length_mm) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n\n\nspeciesislandbill_length_mmbill_depth_mmflipper_length_mmbody_mass_gsexyearAdelieBiscoe3791861723150female2007AdelieBiscoe3781831743400female2007AdelieTorgersen4021701763450female2009AdelieDream3951671783250female2007AdelieDream3721811783900male2007AdelieDream3311611782900female2008\n\n\nTo arrange for descending order, I need to use the desc() function in combination with arrange() like so:\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(flipper_length_mm)) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n\n\nspeciesislandbill_length_mmbill_depth_mmflipper_length_mmbody_mass_gsexyearGentooBiscoe5431572315650male2008GentooBiscoe5001632305700male2007GentooBiscoe5961702306050male2007GentooBiscoe4981682305700male2008GentooBiscoe4861602305800male2008GentooBiscoe5211702305550male2009\n\n\nFurther guidance about arrange() from R4DS:\n\n“If you provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of preceding columns… Missing values are always sorted at the end.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: The dplyr arrange function. The arrange function orders rows from your data frame according to column variables. Here it will order the Palmer Penguins data.frame according to their flipper length. The function can either be used by providing the penguins data.frame as the first argument to the function or by passing the penguins data.frame via a pipe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Selecting columns with select()\nOften your data contains variables you don’t need for the analysis you are performing, or you want to subset them to share with others. To select only the ones you need, or explore subsets of the variables, the select() verb enables you to keep only the columns of interest.\nFigure 4.5 shows the use of select() to choose only the island and year columns, with or without the pipe.\nSelecting the variables contained in the columns can be done in various ways. For example, by the column number, the variable name or by range. Check the help function ?select for more options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: The dplyr select function. This function selects columns from your data frame. Here it will select the island and year columns from Palmer Penguins data.frame. The function can either be used by providing the penguins data.frame as the first argument to the function or by passing the penguins data.frame via a pipe.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s do this a couple of ways, first reminding ourselves of what the columns are using glimpse(). I’ll continue with the piped approach.\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 344\nColumns: 8\n$ species           &lt;fct&gt; Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adel…\n$ island            &lt;fct&gt; Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgerse…\n$ bill_length_mm    &lt;dbl&gt; 39.1, 39.5, 40.3, NA, 36.7, 39.3, 38.9, 39.2, 34.1, …\n$ bill_depth_mm     &lt;dbl&gt; 18.7, 17.4, 18.0, NA, 19.3, 20.6, 17.8, 19.6, 18.1, …\n$ flipper_length_mm &lt;int&gt; 181, 186, 195, NA, 193, 190, 181, 195, 193, 190, 186…\n$ body_mass_g       &lt;int&gt; 3750, 3800, 3250, NA, 3450, 3650, 3625, 4675, 3475, …\n$ sex               &lt;fct&gt; male, female, female, NA, female, male, female, male…\n$ year              &lt;int&gt; 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007…\n\n\nSo we can see the eight column names and that island is column 2 and year is column 8.\nLet’s select by name:\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  select(island, year) |&gt; \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 344\nColumns: 2\n$ island &lt;fct&gt; Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgerse…\n$ year   &lt;int&gt; 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 200…\n\n\nBy column number:\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  select(2,8) |&gt; \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 344\nColumns: 2\n$ island &lt;fct&gt; Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgerse…\n$ year   &lt;int&gt; 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 200…\n\n\nBy negative selection using the minus sign - to exclude the columns we don’t want:\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  select(-species,-bill_length_mm, -bill_depth_mm,\n         -flipper_length_mm,-body_mass_g, -sex) |&gt; \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 344\nColumns: 2\n$ island &lt;fct&gt; Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgerse…\n$ year   &lt;int&gt; 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 200…\n\n\nSee the select documentation for other approaches for using select such as renaming columns, reordering the columns or picking variables with selection helper functions.\n\n\n4.4.4 Creating new columns with mutate()\nAnother common task is to create a new variable or variables, often from existing data within the data frame. For this we use the mutate() verb. It follows the same syntax as for filter(), arrange() and select() in that the first argument is the dataset, and the subsequent arguments are the new variables we wish to create (Figure 4.6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: The dplyr mutate function. The mutate function creates new column variables in your data frame. Here mutate creates a new variable called body_mass_kg in the Palmer Penguins data.frame by dividing the values in the body_mass_g column by 1000 and storing the answer in new variable body_mass_kg. The function can either be used by providing the penguins data.frame as the first argument to the function or by passing the penguins data.frame via a pipe.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere I’ll use the piped syntax again and glimpse() on the output to create a new variable for penguin body mass in kilograms called body_mass_kg from the existing body mass in grams variable by dividing by 1,000 using mutate().\nI’m also going to use select() to select only the species, body_mass_g and new variable body_mass_kg and then head() to view the first six rows to make the output a bit easier to read.\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  mutate(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g/1000) |&gt; \n  select(species, body_mass_g, body_mass_kg) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n\n\nspeciesislandbody_mass_gbody_mass_kgAdelieTorgersen37503.75AdelieTorgersen38003.80AdelieTorgersen32503.25AdelieTorgersenNANAAdelieTorgersen34503.45AdelieTorgersen36503.65",

Let’s remind ourselves of the definition of tidy data:\nThis can come in two forms: long or wide\nWe’ll start with a table of published articles where each row is a set of observations about each article.\nWhat makes it untidy?\nIt’s untidy because here we are interested in the University of Southampton (UoS) affiliations associated with each article. Here, all the individual affiliations for all the institutions affiliated with each paper are combined in a single column rather than their own columns. Therefore the values for each affiliation aren’t in their own cells.\nHence for the purposes of the question we wish to pose, “Which UoS department is affiliated to each article?” the table is untidy in terms of rules 1 and 3.",

In other words a wide table (lots of columns) but sparsely populated. What we want is a table that has only the UoS affiliation observations.\nWhat is our usual trick for obtaining only the observations of interest?\nWe filter the rows. But hang on, we can’t do that unless we have the each affiliation in a row, rather spread across lots of columns. So what do?\nTransforming a table so that columns become rows, or rows become columns is called pivoting. Here, having separated the affiliations and created a wide table with a variable for each affiliation we want to pivot from wide-to-long.\nWhen we pivot wide-to-long, the column names become a new set of observations in a new variable, and the values from each column become another set of observations in a new variable. Everything else is duplicated and hence we end up with lots of rows.\n\nUsing pivot_long we create a table on which we can filter the rows for the UoS affiliations.\n\nFor some articles there may be multiple UoS affiliations, so we may wish to pivot long-to-wide to create a final tidy table with a single row for each article, but columns for each UoS affiliation.\n\n\n6.1.2 Importing\nLet’s start with a small data set called OA-compliance-subset-2023-11-29.xlsx from the repository\n\n# Use the read.xlsx to download and load the excel file into object dat\ndat &lt;- read.xlsx(\"https://github.com/ab604/library-r/raw/main/data/OA-compliance-subset-2023-11-29.xlsx\")\n\nUse the glimpse() function from dplyr to take a peak at this data:\n\nWe can see that the table has 20 rows with 35 columns of variables.\nLooking at the data types, we can see the import function parsed two types of data: &lt;chr&gt; character, meaning strings of text and &lt;dbl&gt; double, meaning numerical data.
