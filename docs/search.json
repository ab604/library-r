Download R here and Download RStudio Desktop here.\nIf you are wondering if and/or why learning R might be useful, 1  Setting the scene should help answer those questions.",

    "text": "Note 1.1: Is programming hard to learn?\n\n\n\n“…programming in general…is primarily about learning to think a certain way - to decompose a problem into very simple steps each of which can be easily solved. Some people have an affinity to this – they will pick it up faster, while others will need more practice.”\nSource: The Biostar Handbook\n\n\n\n1.1.1 But why is it worth doing?\n\nMaybe it isn’t, but experience is one way to find out.\nMy experience is that in the long term, it saves me time and frees up time from doing boring repetitive tasks for doing more interesting things.\n\n\n\n1.1.2 What are we doing?\nFigure 1.1 shows a truncated version of the data science cycle from R4DS. Conceptually, this is what we are mostly doing. I’ve crossed out modelling as that is beyond the scope here, but you may wish to explore the modelling part of the cycle yourself.\nAs a librarian, your data is likely to be in a spreadsheet. We need to learn how to import that data into an environment where we can work with it and explore questions.\nIn asking and answering those questions we need to learn to transform data and/or visualise our data.\nWe then need to communicate our findings back out of our working environment to our colleagues or for our own records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: A truncated version of the data science cycle from R4DS. We will cover data importing, tidying, transformation and visualisation, but not modelling. Communication of your output is the final part of the workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 How are we going to do it?\nAs per Note 1.1, step-by-step and through practice we will learn to think and work in a certain way that may be different to how you have previously worked.\nIt may seem all a bit abstract to begin with, but that is part of the point. In learning to generalise, one can apply the same concepts to lots of specific problems that may at first seem different, but are either the same or similar.\nOur guiding principles in doing this are:\n\nKeep the raw data raw.\nWrite love letters to our future selves in the form of code and how we organise and document our data.",

    "text": "2.3 Installing and loading packages\nPackages are collections of functions, and a function is a piece of code written to perform a specific task, such as installing a package.\nTherefore, the function install.packages() is a piece of code written to perform the task of installing packages.\nWe use the function by typing install.packages(\"tidyverse\") with the name of the package in quotes inside the round brackets.\nHere the package is tidyverse. Using the console panel to type this and pressing Enter will run the function.\nWe of course need to know the name of the packages we are interested in.\nOnce a package is installed we need to load it into our environment to use it. Loading packages is performed using the library() function. As with installation, we put the name of the package - the argument for our function - that we want to load in between the round brackets like so library(tidyverse).\nAs before this can be done on the console, but we will usually load packages as part of script. Note that we don’t need the quotes for the library function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry installing the cowsay package\n\n\n\nNow load cowsay with the library() function. cowsay has one function called say() that you can use to create messages with animals.\n\n\n\n ----- \nUse ?say to open the help\ndocumentation for the say() function. \n ------ \n    \\   ^__^ \n     \\  (oo)\\ ________ \n        (__)\\         )\\ /\\ \n             ||------w|\n             ||      ||\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Introducing the Palmer Penguins\nThe Palmer Penguins package is a dataset curated by Allison Horst of data on three penguin species from the Palmer Station in Antarctica (Figure 2.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Hex sticker of the Palmer Penguins package curated by Allison Horst showing the Chinstrap, Gentoo and Adélie penguins.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a great dataset for getting started with and you can install it like so:\n\ninstall.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\n\nThe three penguins species are the Chinstrap, Gentoo and Adélie penguins (Figure 2.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Artwork by @allison_horst of the Chinstrap, Gentoo and Adélie penguins.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset records various information about 344 penguins, including their culmen (Figure 2.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Artwork by @allison_horst of the culman of a Gentoo penguin.",
