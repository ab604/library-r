	abstract = {Tumor neoantigens are widely used in cancer immunotherapy, and a growing body of research suggests that microbes play an important role in these neoantigen-based immunotherapeutic processes. The human body and its surrounding environment are filled with a large number of microbes that are in long-term interaction with the organism. The microbiota can modulate our immune system, help activate neoantigen-reactive T cells, and play a great role in the process of targeting tumor neoantigens for therapy. Recent studies have revealed the interconnection between microbes and neoantigens, which can cross-react with each other through molecular mimicry, providing theoretical guidance for more relevant studies. The current applications of microbes in immunotherapy against tumor neoantigens are mainly focused on cancer vaccine development and immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This article summarizes the related fields and suggests the importance of microbes in immunotherapy against neoantigens. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors are groundbreaking resources for cancer therapy. However, only a few patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have shown positive responses to anti-PD-1 therapy. Neoantigens are sequence-altered proteins resulting from somatic mutations in cancer. This study identified the neoantigens of Hep-55.1C and Dt81 Hepa1-6 HCCs by comparing their whole exome sequences with those of a normal C57BL/6 mouse liver. Immunogenic long peptides were pooled as peptide vaccines. The vaccination elicited tumor-reactive immune responses in C57BL/6 mice, as demonstrated by IFN-γ ELISPOT and an in vitro killing assay of splenocytes. In the treatment of three mouse HCC models, combined neoantigen vaccination and anti-PD-1 resulted in more significant tumor regression than monotherapies. Flow cytometry of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes showed decreased Treg cells and monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells, increased CD8+ T cells, enhanced granzyme B expression, and reduced exhaustion-related markers PD-1 and Lag-3 on CD8+ T cells in the combination group. These findings provide a strong rationale for conducting clinical studies of using neoantigen vaccination in combination with anti-PD-1 to treat patients with HCC. © 2023},

	abstract = {Objective To establish a rapid, efficient, and feasible personalized new antigen identification and application strategy for patients with lung cancer by constructing a shared-neoantigen peptides library based on hot mutations in non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) and further testing its' immunogenicity in vitro analysis. Methods Cancer tissue, serum circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA), and blood samples were collected from 12 patients with advanced NSCLC who were admitted to the Cancer Center of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing University Medical School from January 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021. High-affinity epitope peptides of common human leukocyte antigen(HLA) types (HLA-A* 0201/0203/0206, HLA-A* 2402, HLA-A" 1101) in the Chinese population were screened by going through dominant gene mutations in NSCLC combining with T cells epitope prediction tool NetMHCpan 4. 0. Tumor specific mutations were identified by second generation sequencing, and HLA precise typing was identified by Polymerase chain reaction sequencing typing(SBT). The test group was set up with the neoantigenic peptide, the positive control group with phytohaemaggluti-nin(PHA), and the negative control group without the peptide. Following multi-rounds in vitro stimulations, the expression levels of IFN-y and CD137 in activating T cells were assessed by ELISPOT and flow cytometry separately. The immunogenicity was evaluated and a new epitope peptide with immunogenicity was identified. Results Fourteen high-affinity neoantigen peptides were devised and synthesized for five widespread HLA groups among Chinese populations, against eight hotspot mutations within three driver genes, including EGFR, TP53 and KRAS. Immunogenicity validation of neo-antigemc shared peptide library epitope peptides was performed in 12 patients, and 10 neoantigenic peptides were validated, of which 11 (91. 60%) patients showed reactivity to the neoantigenic peptides and 90. 00%(9/10) of the neoantigenic peptides responded to matched patients, for a total of 9 neoantigenic peptides with confirmed immunogenicity. In one patient, although IFN-y expression can be observed after multiple rounds of stimulation with its matching new antigen pep-tide(TP53-2) and CD137 positive T cells showed an increasing trend, there was no statistically significant difference compared to the negative control group(P>0. 05). Conclusions This research successfully developed a primary shared neo-antigen peptide library based on hotspot mutations in Chinese NSCLC patients and corroborated its immunogenicity. This innovative strategy presents a promising avenue toward the expeditious identification and acquisition of neoantigens in NSCLC harboring hotspot mutations. By further expanding the neoantigen peptides in this library, it can underpin personalized neoantigen-based immunotherapy. © 2023 Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment, Editorial board.

	abstract = {Background Previous studies confirmed that most neoantigens predicted by algorithms do not work in clinical practice, and experimental validations remain indispensable for confirming immunogenic neoantigens. In this study, we identified the potential neoantigens with tetramer staining, and established the Co-HA system, a single-plasmid system coexpressing patient human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and antigen, to detect the immunogenicity of neoantigens and verify new dominant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) neoantigens. Methods First, we enrolled 14 patients with HCC for next-generation sequencing for variation calling and predicting potential neoantigens. Then, the Co-HA system was established. To test the feasibility of the system, we constructed target cells coexpressing HLA-A∗11:01 and the reported KRAS G12D neoantigen as well as specific T-cell receptor (TCR)-T cells. The specific cytotoxicity generated by this neoantigen was shown using the Co-HA system. Moreover, potential HCC-dominant neoantigens were screened out by tetramer staining and validated by the Co-HA system using methods including flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunospot assay and ELISA. Finally, antitumor test in mouse mode and TCR sequencing were performed to further evaluate the dominant neoantigen. Results First, 2875 somatic mutations in 14 patients with HCC were identified. The main base substitutions were C>T/G>A transitions, and the main mutational signatures were 4, 1 and 16. The high-frequency mutated genes included HMCN1, TTN and TP53. Then, 541 potential neoantigens were predicted. Importantly, 19 of the 23 potential neoantigens in tumor tissues also existed in portal vein tumor thrombi. Moreover, 37 predicted neoantigens restricted by HLA-A∗11:01, HLA-A∗24:02 or HLA-A∗02:01 were performed by tetramer staining to screen out potential HCC-dominant neoantigens. HLA-A∗24:02-restricted epitope 5'-FYAFSCYYDL-3' and HLA-A∗02:01-restricted epitope 5'-WVWCMSPTI-3' demonstrated strong immunogenicity in HCC, as verified by the Co-HA system. Finally, the antitumor efficacy of 5'-FYAFSCYYDL-3'-specific T cells was verified in the B-NDG-B2m tm1 Fcrn tm1(mB2m) mouse and their specific TCRs were successfully identified. Conclusion We found the dominant neoantigens with high immunogenicity in HCC, which were verified with the Co-HA system.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

Herein, based on the rational design of neoantigens, we developed biepitope nanovaccines via integrating CD4+ with CD8+ T cell epitopes. A class of amphiphilic peptides composed of biepitope and hydrophilic amino acids can form well-defined nanostructures, thus incorporating functional sequences into an artificial platform. Cellular uptake studies demonstrated the enhanced endocytosis of biepitope neoantigens in dendritic cells (DCs). Such designed biepitopes can further stimulate the maturation of DCs, as validated by the upregulation of costimulatory molecules and secreted proinflammatory cytokines, which show the potential ability to prime T cells and evoke specific cellular immunity. The inspiring prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of biepitope nanovaccines was evaluated in murine colon cancer. In contrast to individual CD8+ T cell epitopes, the rationally designed biepitope nanovaccines can efficiently provoke immune activation and potentiate antitumor immunity both in vitro and in vivo, presenting an alternative strategy for neoantigen vaccines. © 2023 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The success of cancer immunotherapy depends in part on the strength of antigen recognition by T cells. Here, we characterize the T cell receptor (TCR) functional (antigen sensitivity) and structural (monomeric pMHC-TCR off-rates) avidities of 371 CD8 T cell clones specific for neoantigens, tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) or viral antigens isolated from tumors or blood of patients and healthy donors. T cells from tumors exhibit stronger functional and structural avidity than their blood counterparts. Relative to TAA, neoantigen-specific T cells are of higher structural avidity and, consistently, are preferentially detected in tumors. Effective tumor infiltration in mice models is associated with high structural avidity and CXCR3 expression. Based on TCR biophysicochemical properties, we derive and apply an in silico model predicting TCR structural avidity and validate the enrichment in high avidity T cells in patients’ tumors. These observations indicate a direct relationship between neoantigen recognition, T cell functionality and tumor infiltration. These results delineate a rational approach to identify potent T cells for personalized cancer immunotherapy. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Neoantigens are tumor-specific peptide sequences resulting from sources such as somatic DNA mutations. Upon loading onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, they can trigger recognition by T cells. Accurate neoantigen identification is thus critical for both designing cancer vaccines and predicting response to immunotherapies. Neoantigen identification and prioritization relies on correctly predicting whether the presenting peptide sequence can successfully induce an immune response. Because most somatic mutations are single-nucleotide variants, changes between wild-type and mutated peptides are typically subtle and require cautious interpretation. A potentially underappreciated variable in neoantigen prediction pipelines is the mutation position within the peptide relative to its anchor positions for the patient’s specific MHC molecules. Whereas a subset of peptide positions are presented to the T cell receptor for recognition, others are responsible for anchoring to the MHC, making these positional considerations critical for predicting T cell responses. We computationally predicted anchor positions for different peptide lengths for 328 common HLA alleles and identified unique anchoring patterns among them. Analysis of 923 tumor samples shows that 6 to 38% of neoantigen candidates are potentially misclassified and can be rescued using allele-specific knowledge of anchor positions. A subset of anchor results were orthogonally validated using protein crystallography structures. Representative anchor trends were experimentally validated using peptide-MHC stability assays and competition binding assays. By incorporating our anchor prediction results into neoantigen prediction pipelines, we hope to formalize, streamline, and improve the identification process for relevant clinical studies.

	abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is lethal in 88% of patients1, yet harbours mutation-derived T cell neoantigens that are suitable for vaccines 2,3. Here in a phase I trial of adjuvant autogene cevumeran, an individualized neoantigen vaccine based on uridine mRNA–lipoplex nanoparticles, we synthesized mRNA neoantigen vaccines in real time from surgically resected PDAC tumours. After surgery, we sequentially administered atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy), autogene cevumeran (a maximum of 20 neoantigens per patient) and a modified version of a four-drug chemotherapy regimen (mFOLFIRINOX, comprising folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin). The end points included vaccine-induced neoantigen-specific T cells by high-threshold assays, 18-month recurrence-free survival and oncologic feasibility. We treated 16 patients with atezolizumab and autogene cevumeran, then 15 patients with mFOLFIRINOX. Autogene cevumeran was administered within 3 days of benchmarked times, was tolerable and induced de novo high-magnitude neoantigen-specific T cells in 8 out of 16 patients, with half targeting more than one vaccine neoantigen. Using a new mathematical strategy to track T cell clones (CloneTrack) and functional assays, we found that vaccine-expanded T cells comprised up to 10% of all blood T cells, re-expanded with a vaccine booster and included long-lived polyfunctional neoantigen-specific effector CD8+ T cells. At 18-month median follow-up, patients with vaccine-expanded T cells (responders) had a longer median recurrence-free survival (not reached) compared with patients without vaccine-expanded T cells (non-responders; 13.4 months, P = 0.003). Differences in the immune fitness of the patients did not confound this correlation, as responders and non-responders mounted equivalent immunity to a concurrent unrelated mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, adjuvant atezolizumab, autogene cevumeran and mFOLFIRINOX induces substantial T cell activity that may correlate with delayed PDAC recurrence. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Glial-origin brain tumors, including glioblastomas (GBM), have one of the worst prognoses due to their rapid and fatal progression. From an oncological point of view, advances in complete surgical resection fail to eliminate the entire tumor and the remaining cells allow a rapid recurrence, which does not respond to traditional therapeutic treatments. Here, we have reviewed new immunotherapy strategies in association with the knowledge of the immune micro-environment. To understand the best lines for the future, we address the advances in the design of neoantigen vaccines and possible new immune modulators. Recently, the efficacy and availability of vaccine development with different formulations, especially liposome plus mRNA vaccines, has been observed. We believe that the application of new strategies used with mRNA vaccines in combination with personalized medicine (guided by different omic’s strategies) could give good results in glioma therapy. In addition, a large part of the possible advances in new immunotherapy strategies focused on GBM may be key improving current therapies of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), given the fact that this type of tumor has been highly refractory to ICI. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Neoantigens/ are tumor-specific antigens that evade central immune tolerance mechanisms in the thymus. Long-term tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity maintenance requires class II antigen-reactive CD4+ T cells. We had previously shown that intranodal vaccination with class I neoantigen peptide-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) induced a robust immune response in a subset of patients with metastatic cancer. The present study aimed to perform a detailed ex vivo analysis of immune responses in four patients receiving an intranodal hybrid human leukocyte antigen class II neoantigen peptide encompassing a class I neoantigen epitope (hybrid neoantigen)-pulsed DC vaccine. After vaccination, strong T-cell reactions against the hybrid class II peptide and the class I-binding neoantigen peptide were observed in all four patients. We found that hybrid class II neoantigen peptide-pulsed DCs stimulated CD4+ T cells via direct antigen presentation and CD8+ T cells via cross-presentation. Further, we demonstrated that hybrid class II peptides encompassing multiple class I neoantigen epitope-pulsed DCs could present multiple class I peptides to CD8+ T cells via cross-presentation. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying hybrid neoantigen-pulsed DC vaccine therapy and suggest future neoantigen vaccine design.

I explore the case of the Tumor nEoantigen SeLection Alliance (TESLA), a consortium-based ground-truthing project in personalized cancer immunotherapy, where the ‘truth’ of the targets—immunogenic neoantigens—to be retrieved by the would-be AI algorithms depended on a broad technoscientific network whose setting up implied important organizational and material infrastructures. The study shows that instead of grounding an undisputable ‘truth’, the TESLA endeavor ended up establishing a contestable reference, the biology of neoantigens and how to measure their immunogenicity having slightly evolved alongside this four-year project. However, even if this controversy played down the scope of the TESLA ground truth, it did not discredit the whole undertaking. The magnitude of the technoscientific efforts that the TESLA project set into motion and the needs it ultimately succeeded in filling for the scientific and industrial community counterbalanced its metrological uncertainties, effectively instituting its contestable representation of ‘true’ neoantigens within the field of personalized cancer immunotherapy (at least temporarily). More generally, this case study indicates that the enforcement of ground truths, and what it leaves out, is a necessary condition to enable AI technologies in personalized medicine. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Neoantigens are peptides derived from non-synonymous mutations presented by human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), which are recognized by antitumour T cells1–14. The large HLA allele diversity and limiting clinical samples have restricted the study of the landscape of neoantigen-targeted T cell responses in patients over their treatment course. Here we applied recently developed technologies15–17 to capture neoantigen-specific T cells from blood and tumours from patients with metastatic melanoma with or without response to anti-programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy. We generated personalized libraries of neoantigen–HLA capture reagents to single-cell isolate the T cells and clone their T cell receptors (neoTCRs). Multiple T cells with different neoTCR sequences (T cell clonotypes) recognized a limited number of mutations in samples from seven patients with long-lasting clinical responses. These neoTCR clonotypes were recurrently detected over time in the blood and tumour. Samples from four patients with no response to anti-PD-1 also demonstrated neoantigen-specific T cell responses in the blood and tumour to a restricted number of mutations with lower TCR polyclonality and were not recurrently detected in sequential samples. Reconstitution of the neoTCRs in donor T cells using non-viral CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing demonstrated specific recognition and cytotoxicity to patient-matched melanoma cell lines. Thus, effective anti-PD-1 immunotherapy is associated with the presence of polyclonal CD8+ T cells in the tumour and blood specific for a limited number of immunodominant mutations, which are recurrently recognized over time. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Background Multiple myeloma (MM) cancers originate from plasma cells that have passed through the germinal center reaction where somatic hypermutation of Ig V regions takes place. Myeloma protein V regions often express many mutations and are thus a rich source of neoantigens (traditionally called idiotopes (Id)). Therefore, these are highly tumor-specific and excellent targets for immunotherapy. Methods We have developed a DNA Id vaccine which as translated protein targets conventional dendritic cells (cDC) for CCL3-mediated delivery of myeloma protein V regions in a single-chain fragment variable (scFv) format. Vaccine efficacy was studied in the mouse MM model, mineral oil-induced plasmacytoma 315.BM. Results The Id vaccine protected mice against a challenge with MM cells. Moreover, the vaccine had a therapeutic effect. However, in some of the vaccinated mice, MM cells not producing H chains escaped rejection, resulting in free light chain (FLC) MM. Depletion of CD8+ T cells abrogated vaccine efficacy, and protection was observed to be dependent on cDC1s, using Batf3-/- mice. Modifications of scFv in the vaccine demonstrated that CD8+ T cells were specific for two mutated VH sequences. Conclusions VH neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells elicited by CCL3-containing Id vaccines had a therapeutic effect against MM in a mouse model. MM cells could escape rejection by losing expression of the H chain, thus giving rise to FLC MM. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Vaccines have a long history of promoting immunity to pathogens and, consequently, vaccines targeting cancer neoantigens have been championed as a tool to direct and amplify immune responses against tumours while sparing healthy tissue. In recent years, extensive preclinical research and more than one hundred clinical trials have tested different strategies of neoantigen discovery and vaccine formulations. However, despite the enthusiasm for neoantigen vaccines, proof of unequivocal efficacy has remained beyond reach for the majority of clinical trials.

	abstract = {Neoantigens derived from somatic deoxyribonucleic acid alterations are ideal cancer-specific targets. However, integrated platform for neoantigen discovery is urgently needed. Recently, many scattered experimental evidences suggest that some neoantigens are immunogenic, and comprehensive collection of these experimentally validated neoantigens is still lacking. Here, we have integrated the commonly used tools in the current neoantigen discovery process to form a comprehensive web-based analysis platform. To identify experimental evidences supporting the immunogenicity of neoantigens, we performed comprehensive literature search and constructed the database. The collection of public neoantigens was obtained by using comprehensive features to filter the potential neoantigens from recurrent driver mutations. Importantly, we constructed a graph neural network (GNN) model (Immuno-GNN) using an attention mechanism to consider the spatial interactions between human leukocyte antigen and antigenic peptides for neoantigen immunogenicity prediction. The new easy-to-use R/Shiny web-based neoantigen database and discovery platform, Neodb, contains currently the largest number of experimentally validated neoantigens. In addition to validated neoantigen, Neodb also includes three additional modules for facilitating neoantigen prediction and analysis, including 'Tools' module (comprehensive neoantigen prediction tools); 'Driver-Neo' module (collection of public neoantigens derived from recurrent mutations) and 'Immuno-GNN' module (a novel immunogenicity prediction tool based on a GNN). Immuno-GNN shows improved performance compared with known methods and also represents the first application of GNN model in neoantigen immunogenicity prediction. The construction of Neodb will facilitate the study of neoantigen immunogenicity and the clinical application of neoantigen-based cancer immunotherapy.

	abstract = {In the last years, multiple efforts have been made to accurately predict neoantigens derived from somatic mutations in cancer patients, either to develop personalized therapeutic vaccines or to study immune responses after cancer immunotherapy. In this context, the increasing accessibility of paired whole-exome sequencing (WES) of tumor biopsies and matched normal tissue as well as RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has provided a basis for the development of bioinformatics tools that predict and prioritize neoantigen candidates. Most pipelines rely on the binding prediction of candidate peptides to the patient’s major histocompatibility complex (MHC), but these methods return a high number of false positives since they lack information related to other features that influence T cell responses to neoantigens. This review explores available computational methods that incorporate information on T cell preferences to predict their activation after encountering a peptide-MHC complex. Specifically, methods that predict i) biological features that may increase the availability of a neopeptide to be exposed to the immune system, ii) metrics of self-similarity representing the chances of a neoantigen to break immune tolerance, iii) pathogen immunogenicity, and iv) tumor immunogenicity. Also, this review describes the characteristics of these tools and addresses their performance in the context of a novel benchmark dataset of experimentally validated neoantigens from patients treated with a melanoma vaccine (VACCIMEL) in a phase II clinical study. The overall results of the evaluation indicate that current tools have a limited ability to predict the activation of a cytotoxic response against neoantigens. Based on this result, the limitations that make this problem an unsolved challenge in immunoinformatics are discussed. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Chemotherapeutics have the potential to increase the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies by stimulating the production of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and eliciting mutations that result in the production of neoantigens, thereby increasing the immunogenicity of cancerous lesions. However, the dose-limiting toxicity and limited immunogenicity of chemotherapeutics are not sufficient to induce a robust antitumor response. We hypothesized that cancer cells in vitro treated with ultrahigh doses of various chemotherapeutics artificially increased the abundance, variety, and specificity of DAMPs and neoantigens, thereby improving chemoimmunotherapy. The in vitro chemotherapy-induced (IVCI) nanovaccines manufactured from cell lysates comprised multiple neoantigens and DAMPs, thereby exhibiting comprehensive antigenicity and adjuvanticity. Our IVCI nanovaccines exhibited enhanced immune responses in CT26 tumor-bearing mice, with a significant increase in CD4+/CD8+ T cells in tumors in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. The concept of IVCI nanovaccines provides an idea for manufacturing and artificial enhancement of immunogenicity vaccines to improve chemoimmunotherapy. © 2023 American Chemical Society.},

The success of PD-1 blockade therapy has been attributed to high tumor mutation burden and high immunogenicity of lung cancer cells. To further improve the efficacy of NSCLC immunotherapy and overcome the resistance of lung cancer cells to immune checkpoint blockade, new approaches that enhance the active immune response, such as neoantigen vaccines and cellular-based therapies, are urgently required. Neoantigens are considered ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy because of their high immunogenicity and specificity. In this mini review, we first discuss the current advances in neoantigen vaccines for treating cancers and then review the results of preclinical studies and early-phase human clinical trials of neoantigen-based therapies for NSCLC. Finally, we focus on the identification of neoantigens in patients with NSCLC and review the candidate mutations reported by recent studies and our investigations. The review concludes that, in addition to immune checkpoint blockade, approaches targeting neoantigens are promising for improving the efficacy of NSCLC immunotherapy. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: The availability of (neo)antigens and the infiltration of tumors by (neo)antigen-specific T cells are crucial factors in cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we aimed to investigate the target-ability of (neo)antigens in advanced progessive melanoma and explore the potential for continued T-cell–based immunotherapy. Experimental Design: We examined a cohort of eight patients with melanoma who had sequential metastases resected at early and later time points. Antigen-presenting capacity was assessed using IHC and flow cytometry. T-cell infiltration was quantified through multiplex immunofluorescence. Whole-exome and RNA sequencing were conducted to identify neoantigens and assess the expression of neoantigens and tumor-associated antigens. Mass spectrometry was used to evaluate antigen presentation. Tumor recognition by autologous T cells was assessed by coculture assays with cell lines derived from the metastatic lesions. Results: We observed similar T-cell infiltration in paired early and later metastatic (LM) lesions. Although elements of the antigen-presenting machinery were affected in some LM lesions, both the early and later metastasis-derived cell lines were recognized by autologous T cells. At the genomic level, the (neo)antigen landscape was dynamic, but the (neo)antigen load was stable between paired lesions. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that subsequently isolated tumors from patients with late-stage melanoma retain sufficient antigen-presenting capacity, T-cell infiltration, and a stable (neo) antigen load, allowing recognition of tumor cells by T cells. This indicates a continuous availability of T-cell targets in metastases occurring at different time points and supports further exploration of (neo)antigen-specific T-cell–based therapeutic approaches for advanced melanoma. ©2023 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Background Adoptive transfer of patient's T cells, engineered to express a T cell receptor (TCR) with defined novel antigen specificity, is a convenient form of cancer therapy. In most cases, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I-restricted TCRs are expressed in CD8 + T cells and the development of CD4 + T cells engineered to express an MHC II-restricted TCR lacks behind. Critical is the choice of the target antigen, whether the epitope is efficiently processed and binds with high affinity to MHC molecules. A mutation in the transforming growth factor β receptor 2 (TGFβR2(-1)) gene creates a frameshift peptide caused by the deletion of one adenine (-1) within a microsatellite sequence. This somatic mutation is recurrent in microsatellite instable colorectal and gastric cancers and, therefore, is a truly tumor-specific antigen detected in many patients. Methods ABabDR4 mice, which express a diverse human TCR repertoire restricted to human MHC II molecule HLA-DRA/DRB1∗0401 (HLA-DR4), were immunized with the TGFβR2(-1) peptide and TGFβR2(-1)-specific TCRs were isolated from responding CD4 + T cells. The TGFβR2(-1)-specific TCRs were expressed in human CD4 + T cells and their potency and safety profile were assessed by co-cultures and other functional assays. Results We demonstrated that TGFβR2(-1) neoantigen is immunogenic and elicited CD4 + T cell responses in ABabDR4 mice. When expressed in human CD4 + T cells, the HLA-DR4 restricted TGFβR2(-1)-specific TCRs induced IFNy expression at low TGFβR2(-1) peptide amounts. The TGFβR2(-1)-specific TCRs recognized HLA-DR4 + lymphoblastoid cells, which endogenously processed and presented the neoantigen, and colorectal cancer cell lines SW48 and HCT116 naturally expressing the TGFβR2(-1) mutation. No MHC II alloreactivity or cross-reactivity to peptides with a similar TCR-recognition motif were observed, indicating the safety of the TCRs. Conclusions The data suggest that HLA-DR4-restricted TCRs specific for the TGFβR2(-1) recurrent neoantigen can be valuable candidates for adoptive T cell therapy of a sizeable number of patients with cancer.  © 2023 BioMed Central Ltd..

These highly immunogenic antigens may trigger the immune system to combat cancer cells. Improvements in sequencing technology and computational tools have resulted in several clinical trials of neoantigen vaccines on cancer patients. In this review, we have looked into the design of the vaccines which are undergoing several clinical trials. We have discussed the criteria, processes, and challenges associated with the design of neoantigens. We searched different databases to track the ongoing clinical trials and their reported outcomes. We observed, in several trials, the vaccines boost the immune system to combat the cancer cells while maintaining a reasonable margin of safety. Detection of neoantigens has led to the development of several databases. Adjuvants also play a catalytic role in improving the efficacy of the vaccine. Through this review, we can conclude that the efficacy of vaccines can make it a potential treatment across different types of cancers.

	abstract = {Neoantigens have emerged as promising targets for cutting-edge immunotherapies, such as cancer vaccines and adoptive cell therapy. These neoantigens are unique to tumors and arise exclusively from somatic mutations or non-genomic aberrations in tumor proteins. They encompass a wide range of alterations, including genomic mutations, post-transcriptomic variants, and viral oncoproteins. With the advancements in technology, the identification of immunogenic neoantigens has seen rapid progress, raising new opportunities for enhancing their clinical significance. Prediction of neoantigens necessitates the acquisition of high-quality samples and sequencing data, followed by mutation calling. Subsequently, the pipeline involves integrating various tools that can predict the expression, processing, binding, and recognition potential of neoantigens. However, the continuous improvement of computational tools is constrained by the availability of datasets which contain validated immunogenic neoantigens. This review article aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the current knowledge as well as limitations in neoantigen prediction and validation. Additionally, it delves into the origin and biological role of neoantigens, offering a deeper understanding of their significance in the field of cancer immunotherapy. This article thus seeks to contribute to the ongoing efforts to harness neoantigens as powerful weapons in the fight against cancer. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Although neoantigen-based cancer vaccines have shown promise in various solid tumors, limited immune responses and clinical outcomes have been reported in patients with advanced disease. Cytosolic transport of neoantigen and adjuvant is required for the activation of intracellular Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cross-presentation to prime neoantigen-specific CD8+T cells but remains a significant challenge. Methods: In this study, we aimed to develop a virus-like silicon vaccine (V-scVLPs) with a unique spike topological structure, capable of efficiently co-delivering a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-specific neoantigen and a TLR9 agonist to dendritic cells (DCs) to induce a robust CD8+T cell response to prevent orthotopic tumor growth. We evaluated the antitumor efficacy of V-scVLPs by examining tumor growth and survival time in animal models, as well as analyzing tumor-infiltrating CD8+T cells and cytokine responses in the tumor microenvironment (TME). To evaluate the synergistic efficacy of V-scVLPs in combination with α-TIM-3 in HCC, we used an orthotopic HCC mouse model, a lung metastasis model, and a tumor rechallenge model after hepatectomy. Results: We found that V-scVLPs can efficiently co-deliver the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-specific neoantigen and the TLR9 agonist to DCs via caveolin-mediated endocytosis. This advanced delivery strategy results in efficient lymph node draining of V-scVLPs to activate lymphoid DC maturation for promoting robust CD8+T cells and central memory T cells responses, which effectively prevents orthotopic HCC tumor growth. However, in the established orthotopic liver tumor models, the inhibitory receptor of TIM-3 was significantly upregulated in tumor-infiltrating CD8+T cells after immunization with V-scVLPs. Blocking the TIM-3 signaling further restored the antitumor activity of V-scVLPs-induced CD8+T cells, reduced the proportion of regulatory T cells, and increased the levels of cytokines to alter the tumor microenvironment to efficiently suppress established orthotopic HCC tumor growth, and inhibit lung metastasis as well as recurrence after hepatectomy. Conclusion: Overall, the developed novel spike nanoparticles with efficient neoantigen and adjuvant intracellular delivery capability holds great promise for future clinical translation to improve HCC immunotherapy. © 2023 Ivyspring International Publisher.

	abstract = {KRAS mutations are broadly recognized as promising targets for tumor therapy. T cell receptors (TCRs) can specifically recognize KRAS mutant neoantigens presented by human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) and mediate T cell responses to eliminate tumor cells. In the present study, we identify two TCRs specific for the 9-mer KRAS-G12V mutant neoantigen in the context of HLA-A*11:01. The TCR-T cells are constructed and display cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity upon co-culturing with varied tumor cells expressing the KRAS-G12V mutation. Moreover, 1-2C TCR-T cells show anti-tumor activity in preclinical models in female mice. The 9-mer KRAS-G12V mutant peptide exhibits a distinct conformation from the 9-mer wildtype peptide and its 10-mer counterparts. Specific recognition of the G12V mutant by TCR depends both on distinct conformation from wildtype peptide and on direct interaction with residues from TCRs. Our study reveals the mechanisms of presentation and TCR recognition of KRAS-G12V mutant peptide and describes TCRs with therapeutic potency for tumor immunotherapy. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Malignant neoplasms occupy a leading place among non-communicable diseases based on the number of patients and mortality rate. There are several fundamental approaches to cancer therapy, however, none of them are universal or show a high level of clinical response. Furthermore, all the approaches are characterized by a large number of adverse side effects. Today, immunotherapy used alone or in combination with other therapies is considered to be the most promising. Immunotherapy is usually the use of specific antibodies (immune checkpoint inhibitors) or special bioproducts, such as dendritic cells and artificially synthesized peptides, such as neoantigens. The review considers strategies for development of the dendritic cell- and neoantigen-based anticancer vaccines, the possibilities of their improvement and the efficacy of combining with other anticancer drugs. The summary of current trials of the dendritic cell- and neoantigen-based vaccines is provided along with a brief analysis of the basic strategies, achievements and challenges faced by the developers of such vaccines. © 2023 Journal of Dynamics and Control.

	abstract = {Undifferentiated uveitis (intraocular inflammation, IOI) is an idiopathic sight-threatening, presumed autoimmune disease, accountable for ~ 10% of all blindness in the developed world. We have investigated the association of uveitis with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using a mouse model of spontaneous experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). Mice expressing the transgene (Tg) hen egg lysozyme (HEL) in the retina crossed with 3A9 mice expressing a transgenic HEL-specific TCR spontaneously develop uveoretinitis at post-partum day (P)20/21. Double transgenic (dTg TCR/HEL) mice also spontaneously develop clinical signs of colitis at ~ P30 with diarrhoea, bowel shortening, oedema and lamina propria (LP) inflammatory cell infiltration. Single (s)Tg TCR (3A9) mice also show increased histological LP cell infiltration but no bowel shortening and diarrhoea. dTg TCR/HEL mice are profoundly lymphopenic at weaning. In addition, dTg TCR/HEL mice contain myeloid cells which express MHC Class II-HEL peptide complexes (MHCII-HEL), not only in the inflamed retina but also in the colon and have the potential for antigen presentation. In this model the lymphopenia and reduction in the absolute Treg numbers in dTg TCR/HEL mice is sufficient to initiate eye disease. We suggest that cell-associated antigen released from the inflamed eye can activate colonic HEL-specific T cells which, in a microbial micro-environment, not only cause colitis but feedback to amplify IOI. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Despite the formidable treatment challenges of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), considerable progress has been made in improving drug delivery via pioneering nanocarriers. These innovations are geared towards overcoming the obstacles presented by dysplastic stroma and fostering anti-PDAC immune reactions. We are currently conducting research aimed at enhancing chemotherapy to stimulate anti-tumor immunity by inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD). This is accomplished using lipid bilayer-coated nanocarriers, which enable the attainment of synergistic results. Noteworthy examples include liposomes and lipid-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles known as “silicasomes”. These nanocarriers facilitate remote chemotherapy loading, as well as the seamless integration of immunomodulators into the lipid bilayer. In this communication, we elucidate innovative ways for further improving chemo-immunotherapy. The first is the development of a liposome platform engineered by the remote loading of irinotecan while incorporating a pro-resolving lipoxin in the lipid bilayer. This carrier interfered in stromal collagen deposition, as well as boosting the irinotecan-induced ICD response. The second approach was to synthesize polymer nanoparticles for the delivery of mutated KRAS peptides in conjunction with a TLR7/8 agonist. The dual delivery vaccine particle boosted the generation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cells that are recruited to lymphoid structures at the cancer site, with a view to strengthening the endogenous vaccination response achieved by chemo-immunotherapy. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)–bound peptides that originate from tumor-specific genetic alterations, known as neoantigens, are an important class of anticancer therapeutic targets. Accurately predicting peptide presentation by MHC complexes is a key aspect of discovering therapeutically relevant neoantigens. Technological improvements in mass spectrometry–based immunopeptidomics and advanced modeling techniques have vastly improved MHC presentation prediction over the past 2 decades. However, improvement in the accuracy of prediction algorithms is needed for clinical applications like the development of personalized cancer vaccines, the discovery of biomarkers for response to immunotherapies, and the quantification of autoimmune risk in gene therapies. Toward this end, we generated allele-specific immunopeptidomics data using 25 monoallelic cell lines and created Systematic Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Epitope Ranking Pan Algorithm (SHERPA), a pan-allelic MHC-peptide algorithm for predicting MHC-peptide binding and presentation. In contrast to previously published large-scale monoallelic data, we used an HLA-null K562 parental cell line and a stable transfection of HLA allele to better emulate native presentation. Our dataset includes five previously unprofiled alleles that expand MHC diversity in the training data and extend allelic coverage in underprofiled populations. To improve generalizability, SHERPA systematically integrates 128 monoallelic and 384 multiallelic samples with publicly available immunoproteomics data and binding assay data. Using this dataset, we developed two features that empirically estimate the propensities of genes and specific regions within gene bodies to engender immunopeptides to represent antigen processing. Using a composite model constructed with gradient boosting decision trees, multiallelic deconvolution, and 2.15 million peptides encompassing 167 alleles, we achieved a 1.44-fold improvement of positive predictive value compared with existing tools when evaluated on independent monoallelic datasets and a 1.17-fold improvement when evaluating on tumor samples. With a high degree of accuracy, SHERPA has the potential to enable precision neoantigen discovery for future clinical applications. © 2023 THE AUTHORS.},

	abstract = {Background Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is a promising immunotherapeutic approach for patients with advanced solid tumors. While numerous advances have been made, the contribution of neoantigen-specific CD4 + T cells within TIL infusion products remains underexplored and therefore offers a significant opportunity for progress. Methods We analyzed infused TIL products from metastatic melanoma patients previously treated with ACT for the presence of neoantigen-specific T cells. TILs were enriched on reactivity to neoantigen peptides derived and prioritized from patient sample-directed mutanome analysis. Enriched TILs were further investigated to establish the clonal neoantigen response with respect to function, transcriptomics, and persistence following ACT. Results We discovered that neoantigen-specific TIL clones were predominantly CD4 + T cells and were present in both therapeutic responders and non-responders. CD4 + TIL demonstrated an effector T cell response with cytotoxicity toward autologous tumor in a major histocompatibility complex class II-dependent manner. These results were validated by paired TCR and single cell RNA sequencing, which elucidated transcriptomic profiles distinct to neoantigen-specific CD4 + TIL. Conclusions Despite methods which often focus on CD8+T cells, our study supports the importance of prospective identification of neoantigen-specific CD4 + T cells within TIL products as they are a potent source of tumor-specific effectors. We further advocate for the inclusion of neoantigen-specific CD4 + TIL in future ACT protocols as a strategy to improve antitumor immunity.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

	abstract = {Objectives: The signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) of the stomach is highly invasive. Patients with stage III gastric SRCC usually experience tumor recurrence within 2 years after radical surgery. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment to postpone recurrence following adjuvant chemotherapy. Our study aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of neoantigen-reactive T lymphocytes (NRTs) in patients with stage III gastric SRCC. Methods: The study included 20 patients with stage III gastric SRCC who received radical surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Following the adjuvant chemotherapy, they underwent treatment with a range of one to four cycles of personalised neoantigen-reactive T cells. The primary endpoint was the median progression-free survival (mDFS). The secondary endpoint was safety and immune responses. The median duration of follow-up was 41 months (95% CI: 39–42.9 months). Results: Our results showed that patients who received adjuvant neoantigen-reactive T-cell immunotherapy demonstrated a propensity towards prolonged disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in comparison to previous studies. The 2-year DFS and OS rates reached 73.7% and 95%, respectively, whereas the 5-year DFS and OS rates were 44% and 69%. The median DFS was 41 months (95% CI: 28.9–53.1 months) and the median OS was not reached. In addition, there was a significant increase in serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and IFN-γ after cell immunotherapy. The adverse reactions were mild. Conclusion: In conclusion, adjuvant immunotherapy with NRTs showed promising efficacy alongside a manageable safety profile. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: Cancer neoantigens are important targets of cancer immunotherapy and neoantigen vaccines are currently in development in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and other cancer types. Immune regulatory mechanisms in pancreatic cancer may limit the efficacy of neoantigen vaccines. Targeting immune checkpoint signaling pathways in PDAC may improve the efficacy of neoantigen vaccines. Methods: We used KPC4580P, an established model of PDAC, to test whether neoantigen vaccines can generate therapeutic efficacy against PDAC. We focused on two immunogenic neoantigens associated with genetic alterations in the CAR12 and CDK12 genes. We tested a neoantigen vaccine comprised of two 20-mer synthetic long peptides and poly IC, a Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist. We investigated the ability of neoantigen vaccine alone, or in combination with PD-1 and TIGIT signaling blockade to impact tumor growth. We also assessed the impact of TIGIT signaling on T cell responses in human PDAC. Results: Neoantigen vaccines induce neoantigen-specific T cell responses in tumor-bearing mice and slow KPC4580P tumor growth. However, KPC4580P tumors express high levels of PD-L1 and the TIGIT ligand, CD155. A subset of neoantigen-specific T cells in KPC4580P tumors are dysfunctional, and express high levels of TIGIT. PD-1 and TIGIT signaling blockade in vivo reverses T cell dysfunction and enhances neoantigen vaccine-induced T cell responses and tumor regression. In human translational studies, TIGIT signaling blockade in vitro enhances neoantigen-specific T cell function following vaccination. Conclusions: Taken together, preclinical and human translational studies support testing neoantigen vaccines in combination with therapies targeting the PD-1 and TIGIT signaling pathways in patients with PDAC.

	abstract = {Therapeutic benefit to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is currently limited to the subset of cancers thought to possess a sufficient tumor mutational burden (TMB) to allow for the spontaneous recognition of neoantigens (NeoAg) by autologous T cells. We explored whether the response to ICB of an aggressive low-TMB squamous cell tumor could be improved through combination immunotherapy using functionally defined NeoAg as targets for endogenous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We found that, whereas vaccination with CD4+ or CD8+ NeoAg alone did not offer prophylactic or therapeutic immunity, vaccines containing NeoAg recognized by both subsets overcame ICB resistance and led to the eradication of large established tumors that contained a subset of PD-L1+ tumor-initiating cancer stem cells (tCSC), provided the relevant epitopes were physically linked. Therapeutic CD4+/CD8+ T cell NeoAg vaccination produced a modified tumor microenvironment (TME) with increased numbers of NeoAg-specific CD8+ T cells existing in progenitor and intermediate exhausted states enabled by combination ICB-mediated intermolecular epitope spreading. We believe that the concepts explored herein should be exploited for the development of more potent personalized cancer vaccines that can expand the range of tumors treatable with ICB. © 2023, Dolina et al.},

	abstract = {Background and Aim: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor with high prevalence of KIT and PDGFRA mutations. Few effective treatments can be exploited in imatinib or sunitinib resistant cases. While in immunotherapy, application of the highly individualized cancer neoantigen vaccines is hampered due to high economic and time cost. In this study we identified the most frequent mutation in Chinese GIST patients and predicted candidate neopeptide by next generation sequencing (NGS). Methods: Tumor tissues and matched blood samples of 116 Chinese GIST patients were collected. Genomic profile was detected through NGS, and 450 cancer genes were deeply sequenced. KIT mutations were identified, and long peptides containing the mutation were queried in NetMHCpan 4.0 tools to predict MHC class I binding of mutant peptides. Results: The most frequent mutated genes in detected GIST patients were KIT (81.9%, 95/116), CDKN2A (18.97%, 22/116), and CDKN2B (15.52%, 18/116) in this cohort. The most common mutation of KIT was A502_Y503 duplication (15.93%, 18/113) in exon 9. Among the 116 cases, 103 were HLA I genotyped, and 101 were HLA II genotyped. In total, 16 samples with the mutation of KIT p.A502_Y503dup were identified to produce neoantigens with qualified HLA affinity. Conclusions: KIT hotspot mutation (p.A502_Y503dup) has the highest incidence, which may further eliminate the need for whole genome sequencing and patient-specific neoantigen prediction and synthesis. Therefore, for those carrying such mutation, accounting for around 16% of Chinese GIST patients and are usually less sensitive to imatinib, effective immunotherapies are in prospect. © 2023 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The potency of tumor-specific antigen (TSA) vaccines, such as neoantigen (neoAg)-based cancer vaccines, can be compromised by host immune checkpoint inhibitory mechanisms, such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), that attenuate neoAg presentation on dendritic cells (DC) and hinder T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. To overcome PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition in DCs, we developed a novel adeno-associated virus (meAAV) neoAg vaccine, modified with TLR9 inhibitory fragments, PD-1 trap, and PD-L1 miRNA, which extend the persistence of meAAV and activate neoAg-specific T-cell responses in immune-competent colorectal and breast cancer murine models. Moreover, we found that in combination with radiotherapy, the meAAV-based neoAg cancer vaccine not only elicited higher antigen presentation ability, but also maintained neoAg-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. These functional PD-1 traps and PD-L1 miRNAs overcome host PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory mechanisms and boost the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy. More importantly, combined radiotherapy and meAAV neoAg cancer vaccines significantly enhanced neoAg-specific CTL responses, increased CTL infiltration in tumor microenvironment, and decreased tumor-associated immunosuppression. This process led to the complete elimination of colorectal cancer and delayed tumor growth of breast cancer in tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, our results demonstrated a novel strategy that combines neoAg cancer vaccine and radiotherapy to increase the therapeutic efficacy against colorectal and breast cancers. © 2022 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Neoantigens are emerging as attractive targets to develop personalized cancer vaccines, but their immunization efficacy is severely hampered by their restricted accessibility to lymphoid tissues where immune responses are initiated. Leveraging the capability of red blood cells (RBCs) to capture and present pathogens in peripheral blood to the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in spleen, we developed a RBC-driven spleen targeting strategy to deliver DNA vaccine encoding hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) neoantigen. The DNA vaccine-encapsulating polymeric nanoparticles that were intentionally hitchhiked on the preisolated RBCs could preferentially accumulate in the spleen to promote the neoantigen expression by APCs, resulting in the burst of neoantigen-specific T-cell immunity to prevent tumorigenesis in a personalized manner, and slow down tumor growth in the established aggressively growing HCC. Remarkably, when combined with anti-PD-1, the vaccine achieved complete tumor regression and generated a robust systemic immune response with long-term tumor-specific immunological memory, which thoroughly prevented tumor recurrence and spontaneous lung metastasis. This study offers a prospective strategy to develop personalized neoantigen vaccines for augmenting cancer immunotherapy efficiency in immune “cold” HCC. © 2023 The Authors.

We report a single-arm, open-label and non-randomized phase 1 study (NCT02959905) of Neo-T therapy with lymphodepletion at various dose intensity in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapies. The primary end point is safety and the secondary end points are disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS). Results show that the treatment is well tolerated with lymphopenia being the most common adverse event in the highest-intensity lymphodepletion groups. Neo-T infusion-related adverse events are only grade 1–2 in the no lymphodepletion group. The median PFS is 7.1 months (95% CI:3.7-9.8), the median OS is 16.8 months (95% CI: 11.9-31.7), and the DCR is 66.7% (6/9) among all groups. Three patients achieve partial response, two of them are in the no lymphodepletion group. In the group without lymphodepletion pretreatment, one patient refractory to prior anti-PD1 therapy shows partial response to Neo-T therapy. Neoantigen specific TCRs are examined in two patients and show delayed expansion after lymphodepletion treatment. In summary, Neo-T therapy without lymphodepletion could be a safe and promising regimen for advanced solid tumors. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint blockades, play a critically important role in cancer treatments. For immunotherapies, neoantigens, which are generated by somatic mutations in cancer cells, are thought to be good targets due to their tumor specificity. Because neoantigens are unique in individual cancers, it is challenging to develop personalized immunotherapy targeting neoantigens. In this study, we screened "shared neoantigens", which are specific types of neoantigens derived from mutations observed commonly in a subset of cancer patients. Using exome sequencing data in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we predicted shared neoantigen peptides and performed in vitro screening of shared neoantigen-reactive CD8+ T cells using peripheral blood from healthy donors. We examined the functional activity of neoantigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) by generating TCR-engineered T cells. Among the predicted shared neoantigens from TCGA data, we found that the mutated FGFR3Y373C peptide induced antigen-specific CD8+ T cells from the donor with HLA-A*02:06 via an ELISPOT assay. Subsequently, we obtained FGFR3Y373C-specific CD8+ T cell clones and identified two different sets of TCRs specifically reactive to FGFR3Y373C. We found that the TCR-engineered T cells expressing FGFR3Y373C-specific TCRs recognized the mutated FGFR3Y373C peptide but not the corresponding wild-type peptide. These two FGFR3Y373C-specific TCR-engineered T cells showed cytotoxic activity against mutated FGFR3Y373C-loaded cells. These results imply the possibility of strategies of immunotherapies targeting shared neoantigens, including cancer vaccines and TCR-engineered T cell therapies. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Neoantigens are tumor-specific antigens that are mostly particular for each patient. Since the immune system is able to mount a specific immune response against these neoantigens, they are a promising tool for the development of therapeutic personalized cancer vaccines. Neoantigens must be presented to T cells by antigen presenting cells (APC) in the context of MHC-I or MHC-II molecules. Therefore, the strategy of vaccine delivery may have a major impact on the magnitude and quality of T cell responses. Neoantigen-based vaccines are frequently administered as a pool of individual synthetic peptides that induce mainly CD4+ T cell responses. MHC-I-mediated presentation and the elicitation of CD8+ T cell responses may be improved using DNA or RNA sequences that code for a unique long polypeptide that concatenates the different neoantigens spaced by linker sequences. When administered this way, the selection of the spacer between neoantigens is of special interest, as it might influence the processing and presentation of the right peptides by APCs. Here, we evaluate the impact of such linker regions on the MHC-I-dependent antigen presentation using an in vitro assay that assesses the MHC-I presentation of SIINFEKL, a H-2 Kb-restricted OVA peptide. Our results show that spacers used to generate epitope concatenates have a large impact on the efficiency of neoantigen processing and presentation by MHC-I molecules; in contrast, the peptide position and the flanking regions have a minimal impact. Moreover, linkers based on alanine residues promote a more efficient peptide presentation than the commonly used GGGS linker. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Neoantigens derived from somatic mutations in cancer cells can induce antigen-specific T-cell immune response for cancer immunotherapy. However, the 3D models for assessing neoepitope immunogenicity and efficacy of anti-tumor T-cell immune response to neoantigens are less than perfect. Here, a 3D tumor model based on recellularized liver matrix is leveraged with HepG2 cells to investigate T cell cytotoxic reactivity toward hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) neoantigens. The whole exome sequencing (WES) data of 364 HCC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas database are collected and 25 highly potential immunogenic neoantigens to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02:01 molecule in silico are predicted. Six of the HCC neoantigen candidates are functionally validated with high immunogenicity by measuring cellular interferon-γ secretion and cytotoxicity during neoantigen-specific T-cell immune responses in vitro. Then, the minigene of six functionally identified neoantigen peptides is constructed and the minigene-modified GFP-HepG2 cells are generated. Neoantigen-specific immune response is observed with highly secreted Granzyme B, IFN-γ, and PD-1 when targeting the minigene-modified GFP-HepG2 cells in the 3D RLM HCC tumor model. Overall, the 3D RLM tumor model provides a novel strategy for preclinical assessment of the efficacy of neoantigen-specific T cell immune response, which helps develop personalized cancer vaccines and immunotherapy treatments for HCC patients. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Specificity remains a major challenge to current therapeutic strategies for cancer. Mutation associated neoantigens (MANAs) are products of genetic alterations, making them highly specific therapeutic targets. MANAs are HLA-presented (pHLA) peptides derived from intracellular mutant proteins that are otherwise inaccessible to antibody-based therapeutics. Here, we describe the cryo-EM structure of an antibody-MANA pHLA complex. Specifically, we determine a TCR mimic (TCRm) antibody bound to its MANA target, the KRASG12V peptide presented by HLA-A*03:01. Hydrophobic residues appear to account for the specificity of the mutant G12V residue. We also determine the structure of the wild-type G12 peptide bound to HLA-A*03:01, using X-ray crystallography. Based on these structures, we perform screens to validate the key residues required for peptide specificity. These experiments led us to a model for discrimination between the mutant and the wild-type peptides presented on HLA-A*03:01 based exclusively on hydrophobic interactions. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is often caused by mutations in the KRAS oncogene, making KRAS neoantigens a promising vaccine candidate for immunotherapy. Secreting KRAS antigens using live Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) vaccine delivery hosts such as Lactococcus lactis is deemed to be an effective strategy in inducing specific desired responses. Recently, through the engineering of a novel signal peptide SPK1 from Pediococcus pentosaceus, an optimized secretion system was developed in the L. lactis NZ9000 host. In this study, the potential of the L. lactis NZ9000 as a vaccine delivery host for the production of two KRAS oncopeptides (mutant 68V-DT and wild-type KRAS) through the use of the signal peptide SPK1 and its mutated derivative (SPKM19) was investigated. The expression and secretion efficiency analyses of KRAS peptides from L. lactis were performed in vitro and in vivo in BALB/c mice. Contradictory to our previous study using the reporter staphylococcal nuclease (NUC), the yield of secreted KRAS antigens mediated by the target mutant signal peptide SPKM19 was significantly lower (by ~1.3-folds) compared to the wild-type SPK1. Consistently, a superior elevation of IgA response against KRAS aided by SPK1 rather than mutant SPKM19 was observed. Despite the lower specific IgA response for SPKM19, a positive IgA immune response from mice intestinal washes was successfully triggered following immunization. Size and secondary conformation of the mature proteins are suggested to be the contributing factors for these discrepancies. This study proves the potential of L. lactis NZ9000 as a host for oral vaccine delivery due to its ability to evoke the desired mucosal immune response in the gastrointestinal tract of mice. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Identification of tumor specific neoantigen (TSN) immunogenicity is crucial to develop peptide/mRNA based anti-tumoral vaccines and/or adoptive T-cell immunotherapies; thus, accurate in-silico classification/prioritization proves critical for cost-effective clinical applications. Several methods were proposed as TSNs immunogenicity predictors; however, comprehensive performance comparison is still lacking due to the absence of well documented and adequate TSN databases. Methods: Here, by developing a new curated database having 199 TSNs with experimentally-validated MHC-I presentation and positive/negative immune response (ITSNdb), sixteen metrics were evaluated as immunogenicity predictors. In addition, by using a dataset emulating patient derived TSNs and immunotherapy cohorts containing predicted TSNs for tumor neoantigen burden (TNB) with outcome association, the metrics were evaluated as TSNs prioritizers and as immunotherapy response biomarkers. Results: Our results show high performance variability among methods, highlighting the need for substantial improvement. Deep learning predictors were top ranked on ITSNdb but show discrepancy on validation databases. In overall, current predicted TNB did not outperform existing biomarkers. Conclusion: Recommendations for their clinical application and the ITSNdb are presented to promote development and comparison of computational TSNs immunogenicity predictors.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) technologies have made significant advances since the early 2010s, enabling detection of rare but clinically relevant neoantigens recognized by T cells. MS profiling of tumor-specific immunopeptidomes remains the most direct method to identify mutant peptides bound to cellular MHC. However, the need for use of large numbers of cells or significant amounts of tumor tissue to achieve neoantigen detection has historically limited the application of MS. Newer, more sensitive MS technologies have recently demonstrated the capacities to detect neoantigens from fewer cells. Here, we highlight recent advancements in immunopeptidomics-based characterization of tumor-specific neoantigens. Various tumor antigen categories and neoantigen identification approaches are also discussed. Furthermore, we summarize recent reports that achieved successful tumor neoantigen detection by MS using a variety of starting materials, MS acquisition modes, and novel ion mobility devices. © 2023},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Neoantigens, tumor-specific protein fragments, are invaluable in cancer immunotherapy due to their ability to serve as targets for the immune system. Computational prediction of these neoantigens from sequencing data often requires multiple algorithms and sophisticated workflows, which are currently restricted to specific types of variants, such as single-nucleotide variants or insertions/deletions. Nevertheless, other sources of neoantigens are often overlooked. RESULTS: We introduce ScanNeo2 an improved and fully automated bioinformatics pipeline designed for high-throughput neoantigen prediction from raw sequencing data. Unlike its predecessor, ScanNeo2 integrates multiple sources of somatic variants, including canonical- and exitron-splicing, gene fusion events, and various somatic variants. Our benchmark results demonstrate that ScanNeo2 accurately identifies neoantigens, providing a comprehensive and more efficient solution for neoantigen prediction.

	abstract = {The field of cancer neoantigen investigation has developed swiftly in the past decade. Predicting novel and true neoantigens derived from large multi-omics data became difficult but critical challenges. The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) in biomedicine application has brought benefits to strengthen the current computational pipeline for neoantigen prediction. ML algorithms offer powerful tools to recognize the multidimensional nature of the omics data and therefore extract the key neoantigen features enabling a successful discovery of new neoantigens. The present review aims to outline the significant technology progress of machine learning approaches, especially the newly deep learning tools and pipelines, that were recently applied in neoantigen prediction. In this review article, we summarize the current state-of-the-art tools developed to predict neoantigens. The standard workflow includes calling genetic variants in paired tumor and blood samples, and rating the binding affinity between mutated peptide, MHC (I and II) and T cell receptor (TCR), followed by characterizing the immunogenicity of tumor epitopes. More specifically, we highlight the outstanding feature extraction tools and multi-layer neural network architectures in typical ML models. It is noted that more integrated neoantigen-predicting pipelines are constructed with hybrid or combined ML algorithms instead of conventional machine learning models. In addition, the trends and challenges in further optimizing and integrating the existing pipelines are discussed. Copyright © 2023 Cai, Chen, Gao, Li, Liu, Su, Song, Jiang, Jiang and Zhang.},

	abstract = {The development of a neoantigen-based personalized vaccine has promise in the hunt for cancer immunotherapy. The challenge in neoantigen vaccine design is the need to rapidly and accurately identify, in patients, those neoantigens with vaccine potential. Evidence shows that neoantigens can be derived from noncoding sequences, but there are few specific tools for identifying neoantigens in noncoding regions. In this work, we describe a proteogenomics-based pipeline, namely PGNneo, for use in discovering neoantigens derived from the noncoding region of the human genome with reliability. In PGNneo, four modules are included: (1) noncoding somatic variant calling and HLA typing; (2) peptide extraction and customized database construction; (3) variant peptide identification; (4) neoantigen prediction and selection. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of PGNneo and applied and validated our methodology in two real-world hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cohorts. TP53, WWP1, ATM, KMT2C, and NFE2L2, which are frequently mutating genes associated with HCC, were identified in two cohorts and corresponded to 107 neoantigens from non-coding regions. In addition, we applied PGNneo to a colorectal cancer (CRC) cohort, demonstrating that the tool can be extended and verified in other tumor types. In summary, PGNneo can specifically detect neoantigens generated by noncoding regions in tumors, providing additional immune targets for cancer types with a low tumor mutational burden (TMB) in coding regions. PGNneo, together with our previous tool, can identify coding and noncoding region-derived neoantigens and, thus, will contribute to a complete understanding of the tumor immune target landscape. PGNneo source code and documentation are available at Github. To facilitate the installation and use of PGNneo, we provide a Docker container and a GUI. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has provided revolutionary results in treating various cancers. However, its efficacy in colorectal cancer (CRC), especially in microsatellite stability-CRC, is limited. This study aimed to observe the efficacy of personalized neoantigen vaccine in treating MSS–CRC patients with recurrence or metastasis after surgery and chemotherapy. Candidate neoantigens were analyzed from whole-exome and RNA sequencing of tumor tissues. The safety and immune response were assessed through adverse events and ELISpot. The clinical response was evaluated by progression-free survival (PFS), imaging examination, clinical tumor marker detection, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing. Changes in health-related quality of life were measured by the FACT-C scale. A total of six MSS–CRC patients with recurrence or metastasis after surgery and chemotherapy were administered with personalized neoantigen vaccines. Neoantigen-specific immune response was observed in 66.67% of the vaccinated patients. Four patients remained progression-free up to the completion of clinical trial. They also had a significantly longer progression-free survival time than the other two patients without neoantigen-specific immune response (19 vs. 11 months). Changes in health-related quality of life improved for almost all patients after the vaccine treatment. Our results shown that personalized neoantigen vaccine therapy is likely to be a safe, feasible and effective strategy for MSS–CRC patients with postoperative recurrence or metastasis. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: We present here a strategy to identify immunogenic neoantigen candidates from unique amino acid sequences at the junctions of fusion proteins which can serve as targets in the development of tumor vaccines for the treatment of breastcancer. Method: We mined the sequence reads of breast tumor tissue that are usually discarded as discordant paired-end reads and discovered cancer specific fusion transcripts using tissue from cancer free controls as reference. Binding affinity predictions of novel peptide sequences crossing the fusion junction were analyzed by the MHC Class I binding predictor, MHCnuggets. CD8+ T cell responses against the 15 peptides were assessed through in vitro Enzyme Linked Immunospot (ELISpot). Results: We uncovered 20 novel fusion transcripts from 75 breast tumors of 3 subtypes: TNBC, HER2+, and HR+. Of these, the NSFP1-LRRC37A2 fusion transcript was selected for further study. The 3833 bp chimeric RNA predicted by the consensus fusion junction sequence is consistent with a read-through transcription of the 5’-gene NSFP1-Pseudo gene NSFP1 (NSFtruncation at exon 12/13) followed by trans-splicing to connect withLRRC37A2 located immediately 3’ through exon 1/2. A total of 15 different 8-mer neoantigen peptides discovered from the NSFP1 and LRRC37A2 truncations were predicted to bind to a total of 35 unique MHC class I alleles with a binding affinity of IC50<500nM.); 1 of which elicited a robust immune response. Conclusion: Our data provides a framework to identify immunogenic neoantigen candidates from fusion transcripts and suggests a potential vaccine strategy to target the immunogenic neopeptides in patients with tumors carrying the NSFP1-LRRC37A2 fusion.

	abstract = {Background Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) corresponds to approximately 20% of all breast tumors, with a high propensity for metastasis and a poor prognosis. Because TNBC displays a high mutational load compared with other breast cancer types, a neoantigen-based immunotherapy strategy could be effective. One major bottleneck in the development of a neoantigen-based vaccine for TNBC is the selection of the best targets, that is, tumor-specific neoantigens which are presented at the surface of tumor cells and capable of eliciting robust immune responses. In this study, we aimed to set up a platform for identification and delivery of immunogenic neoantigens in a vaccine regimen for TNBC using oncolytic vaccinia virus (VV). Methods We used bioinformatic tools and cell-based assays to identify immunogenic neoantigens in TNBC patients' samples, human and murine cell lines. Immunogenicity of the neoantigens was tested in vitro (human) and ex vivo (murine) in T-cell assays. To assess the efficacy of our regimen, we used a preclinical model of TNBC where we treated tumor-bearing mice with neoantigens together with oncolytic VV and evaluated the effect on induction of neoantigen-specific CD8+T cells, tumor growth and survival. Results We successfully identified immunogenic neoantigens and generated neoantigen-specific CD8+T cells capable of recognizing a human TNBC cell line expressing the mutated gene. Using a preclinical model of TNBC, we showed that our tumor-specific oncolytic VV was able to change the tumor microenvironment, attracting and maintaining mature cross-presenting CD8α+dendritic cells and effector T-cells. Moreover, when delivered in a prime/boost regimen together with oncolytic VV, long peptides encompassing neoantigens were able to induce neoantigen-specific CD8+T cells, slow tumor growth and increase survival. Conclusions Our study provides a promising approach for the development of neoantigen-based immunotherapies for TNBC. By identifying immunogenic neoantigens and developing a delivery system through tumor-specific oncolytic VV, we have demonstrated that neoantigen-based vaccines could be effective in inducing neoantigen-specific CD8+T cells response with significant impact on tumor growth. Further studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of this approach in clinical trials.  © 2023 Author(s). Published by BMJ.},

	abstract = {Altered protein phosphorylation in cancer cells often leads to surface presentation of phosphopeptide neoantigens. However, their role in cancer immunogenicity remains unclear. Here we describe a mechanism by which an HLA-B*0702-specific acute myeloid leukemia phosphoneoantigen, pMLL747–755 (EPR(pS)PSHSM), is recognized by a cognate T cell receptor named TCR27, a candidate for cancer immunotherapy. We show that the replacement of phosphoserine P4 with serine or phosphomimetics does not affect pMHC conformation or peptide-MHC affinity but abrogates TCR27-dependent T cell activation and weakens binding between TCR27 and pMHC. Here we describe the crystal structures for TCR27 and cognate pMHC, map of the interface produced by nuclear magnetic resonance, and a ternary complex generated using information-driven protein docking. Our data show that non-covalent interactions between the epitope phosphate group and TCR27 are crucial for TCR specificity. This study supports development of new treatment options for cancer patients through target expansion and TCR optimization. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Autophagy constitutes a well-known homeostatic and catabolic process that is responsible for degradation and recycling of cellular components. It is a key regulatory mechanism for several cellular functions, whereas its dysregulation is associated with tumorigenesis, tumor–stroma interactions and resistance to cancer therapy. A growing body of evidence has proven that autophagy affects the tumor microenvironment, while it is also considered a key factor for function of several immune cells, such as APCs, T-cells, and macrophages. Moreover, it is implicated in presentation of neo-antigens of tumor cells in both MHC-I and MHC-II in dendritic cells (DCs) in functional activity of immune cells by creating T-cell memory, as well as in cross-presentation of neo-antigens for MHC-I presentation and the internalization process. Currently, autophagy has a crucial role in immunotherapy. Emergence of cancer immunotherapy has already shown some remarkable results, having changed therapeutic strategy in clinical practice for several cancer types. Despite these promising long-term responses, several patients seem to lack the ability to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Thus, autophagy through neo-antigen presentation is a potential target in order to strengthen or attenuate the effects of immunotherapy against different types of cancer. This review will shed light on the recent advances and future directions of autophagy-dependent neo-antigen presentation and consequently its role in immunotherapy for malignant tumors. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The mutation of the crucial genes such as tumor suppressors or oncogenes plays an important role in the initiation and development of tumors. The non-synonymous mutations in the tumor cell genome will produce non-autologous proteins (neoantigen) to activate the immune system by activating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Neoantigen-based peptide vaccines have exhibited exciting therapeutic effects in treating various cancers alone or in combination with other therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, antigen-loaded DC vaccines are more powerful in inducing stronger immune responses than vaccines generated by antigens and adjuvants. Therefore, neoantigen-based dendritic cell (DC) vaccines could achieve promising effects in combating some malignant tumors. In this review, we summarized and discussed the recent research progresses of the neoantigen, neoantigen-based vaccines, and DC-based vaccine in pancreatic cancers (PCs). The combination of the neoantigen and DC-based vaccine in PC was also highlighted. Therefore, our work will provide more detailed evidence and novel opinions to promote the development of a personalized neoantigen-based DC vaccine for PC.

	abstract = {Introduction: The cell line MC38 is a commonly used murine model for colorectal carcinoma. It has a high mutational burden, is sensitive to immune checkpoint immunotherapy and endogenous CD8+ T cell responses against neoantigens have been reported. Methods: Here, we re-sequenced exomes and transcriptomes of MC38 cells from two different sources, namely Kerafast (originating from NCI/NIH, MC38-K) and the Leiden University Medical Center cell line collection (MC38-L), comparing the cell lines on the genomic and transcriptomic level and analyzing their recognition by CD8+ T cells with known neo-epitope specificity. Results: The data reveals a distinct structural composition of MC38-K and MC38-L cell line genomes and different ploidies. Further, the MC38-L cell line harbored about 1.3-fold more single nucleotide variations and small insertions and deletions than the MC38-K cell line. In addition, the observed mutational signatures differed; only 35.3% of the non-synonymous variants and 5.4% of the fusion gene events were shared. Transcript expression values of both cell lines correlated strongly (p = 0.919), but we found different pathways enriched in the genes that were differentially upregulated in the MC38-L or MC38-K cells, respectively. Our data show that previously described neoantigens in the MC38 model such as Rpl18mut and Adpgkmut were absent in the MC38-K cell line resulting that such neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells recognizing and killing MC38-L cells did not recognize or kill MC38-K cells. Conclusion: This strongly indicates that at least two sub-cell lines of MC38 exist in the field and underlines the importance of meticulous tracking of investigated cell lines to obtain reproducible results, and for correct interpretation of the immunological data without artifacts. We present our analyses as a reference for researchers to select the appropriate sub-cell line for their own studies.

	abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays crucial roles in several important biological functions such as embryogenesis, epithelial tissue development, and cellular regeneration. However, in multiple solid tumor types overexpression and/or activating mutations of the EGFR gene frequently occur, thus hijacking the EGFR signaling pathway to promote tumorigenesis. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors in particular often contain prevalent and shared EGFR mutations that provide an ideal source for public neoantigens (NeoAg). Studies in both humans and animal models have confirmed the immunogenicity of some of these NeoAg peptides, suggesting that they may constitute viable targets for cancer immunotherapies. Peptide vaccines targeting mutated EGFR have been tested in multiple clinical trials, demonstrating an excellent safety profile and encouraging clinical efficacy. For example, the CDX-110 (rindopepimut) NeoAg peptide vaccine derived from the EGFRvIII deletion mutant in combination with temozolomide and radiotherapy has shown efficacy in treating EGFRvIII-harboring glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients undergone surgery in multiple Phase I and II clinical trials. Furthermore, pilot clinical trials that have administered personalized NeoAg peptides for treating advanced-stage NSCLC patients have shown this approach to be a feasible and safe method to increase antitumor immune responses. Amongst the vaccine peptides administered, EGFR mutation-targeting NeoAgs induced the strongest T cell-mediated immune responses in patients and were also associated with objective clinical responses, implying a promising future for NeoAg peptide vaccines for treating NSCLC patients with selected EGFR mutations. The efficacy of NeoAg-targeting peptide vaccines may be further improved by combining with other modalities such as tyrosine kinase or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, which are currently being tested in animal models and clinical trials. Herein, we review the most current basic and clinical research progress on EGFR-targeted peptide vaccination for the treatment of NSCLC and other solid tumor types. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The accurate selection of neoantigens that bind to class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and are recognized by autologous T cells is a crucial step in many cancer immunotherapy pipelines. We reprocessed whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from 120 cancer patients from two external large-scale neoantigen immunogenicity screening assays combined with an in-house dataset of 11 patients and identified 46,017 somatic single-nucleotide variant mutations and 1,781,445 neo-peptides, of which 212 mutations and 178 neo-peptides were immunogenic. Beyond features commonly used for neoantigen prioritization, factors such as the location of neo-peptides within protein HLA presentation hotspots, binding promiscuity, and the role of the mutated gene in oncogenicity were predictive for immunogenicity. The classifiers accurately predicted neoantigen immunogenicity across datasets and improved their ranking by up to 30%. Besides insights into machine learning methods for neoantigen ranking, we have provided homogenized datasets valuable for developing and benchmarking companion algorithms for neoantigen-based immunotherapies. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Further studies provided evidence that the response to ICB is also affected by the qualitative properties of a few or even single candidates, limiting the predictive power based on candidate quantity alone. Here, we predict ICB efficacy based on neoantigen candidates and their neoantigen features in the context of the mutation type, using Multiple-Instance Learning via Embedded Instance Selection (MILES). Multiple instance learning is a type of supervised machine learning that classifies labeled bags that are formed by a set of unlabeled instances. MILES performed better compared with neoantigen candidate load alone for low-abundant fusion genes in renal cell carcinoma. Our findings suggest that MILES is an appropriate method to predict the efficacy of ICB therapy based on neoantigen candidates without requiring direct T cell response information. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Purpose of reviewCancer vaccines are facing renewed interest, thanks to the progress recently achieved in the immunotherapy field, including the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). The advances in understanding the CPI mode of action revealed a central role of neoantigens for the outcome of such treatments. Neoantigens became the preferred antigens for cancer vaccines and have been evaluated in several clinical trials. Here, we review the recent results from neoantigen-based vaccines in melanoma patients and discuss avenues for improvement.Recent findingsThe importance of neoantigens for tumor control comes from the positive correlation between tumor mutational burden (TMB) and response to CPI. Preclinical studies have proved the effectiveness of neoantigen vaccines in models, expediting their clinical testing. Tumor mutations are not shared in most tumor types including melanoma, mandating the need of a personalized approach. Several clinical studies have shown the safety, feasibility, immunogenicity and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of personalized vaccination. Currently, new trials have been started aiming to both confirm clinical activity and combining vaccines with other immunotherapies for improved efficacy.SummaryPersonalized vaccines hold the promise for highly mutated and immunogenic cancers, including melanoma.

	abstract = {Systemic pan-tumor analyses may reveal the significance of common features implicated in cancer immunogenicity and patient survival. Here, we provide a comprehensive multi-omics data set for 32 patients across 25 tumor types for proteogenomic-based discovery of neoantigens. By using an optimized computational approach, we discover a large number of tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens. To create a pipeline for the identification of neoantigens in our cohort, we combine DNA and RNA sequencing with MS-based immunopeptidomics of tumor specimens, followed by the assessment of their immunogenicity and an in-depth validation process. We detect a broad variety of non-canonical HLA-binding peptides in the majority of patients demonstrating partially immunogenicity. Our validation process allows for the selection of 32 potential neoantigen candidates. The majority of neoantigen candidates originates from variants identified in the RNA data set, illustrating the relevance of RNA as a still understudied source of cancer antigens. This study underlines the importance of RNA-centered variant detection for the identification of shared biomarkers and potentially relevant neoantigen candidates. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: Neoantigen-based immunotherapy has emerged as a promising strategy for improving the life expectancy of cancer patients. This therapeutic approach heavily relies on accurate identification of cancer mutations using DNA sequencing (DNAseq) data. However, current workflows tend to provide a large number of neoantigen candidates, of which only a limited number elicit efficient and immunogenic T-cell responses suitable for downstream clinical evaluation. To overcome this limitation and increase the number of high-quality immunogenic neoantigens, we propose integrating RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data into the mutation identification step in the neoantigen prediction workflow. Methods: In this study, we characterize the mutation profiles identified from DNAseq and/or RNAseq data in tumor tissues of 25 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Immunogenicity was then validated by ELISpot assay using long synthesis peptides (sLP). Results: We detected only 22.4% of variants shared between the two methods. In contrast, RNAseq-derived variants displayed unique features of affinity and immunogenicity. We further established that neoantigen candidates identified by RNAseq data significantly increased the number of highly immunogenic neoantigens (confirmed by ELISpot) that would otherwise be overlooked if relying solely on DNAseq data. Discussion: This integrative approach holds great potential for improving the selection of neoantigens for personalized cancer immunotherapy, ultimately leading to enhanced treatment outcomes and improved survival rates for cancer patients.

	abstract = {Immunogenic neoantigens derived from somatic mutations in cancer have been identified through clinical studies with the cloning of tumor-infiltrating T cells, and cancer driver gene mutation-derived epitopes have been reported; however, these are rare. At present, the validation of epitopes predicted in silico is difficult as human T-cell clonal diversity cannot be reproduced in vitro or in experimental animal models. To confirm the epitope peptides presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules predicted in silico, biochemical methods such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) stabilization assays and mass spectrometry-mediated identification have been developed based on HLA-A*02:01 monoallelic T2 cells and HLA-C*01:02 monoallelic LCL721.221 cells. Therefore, in the present study, to prevent confusion due to peptide cross-presentation among HLA molecules, HLA class I monoallelic B-cell clones were generated from the TISI cell line by knocking out HLA-ABC and TAP2, and knocking in HLA alleles. To explore cancer driver mutations as potential targets for immunotherapy, exome sequencing data from 5,143 patients with cancer enrolled in a comprehensive genome analysis project at the Shizuoka Cancer Center were used to identify somatic amino acid substituted mutations and the 50 most frequent mutations in five genes, TP53, EGFR, PIK3CA, KRAS and BRAF, were identified. Using NetMHC4.1, the present study predicted whether epitopes derived from these mutations are presented on major HLA-ABC alleles in Japanese individuals and synthesized 138 peptides for MHC stabilization assays. The authors also attempted to examine the candidate epitopes at physiological temperatures by using antibody clone G46-2.6, which can detect HLA-ABC, independent of β2-microglobulin association. In the assays, although the peptide-induced HLA expression levels were associated with the predicted affinities, the respective HLA alleles exhibited varying degrees of responsiveness, and unexpectedly, p53-mutant epitopes with predicted weak affinities exhibited strong responses. These results suggested that MHC stabilization assays using completely monoallelic HLA-expressing B-cell lines are useful for evaluating the presentation of neoantigen epitopes.

These neoantigens are targets for cancer, as shown by the implementation of neoepitope peptides as cancer vaccines. The success of cost-effective multi-epitope mRNA vaccines against SARS-Cov-2 in the pandemic established a model for reverse vaccinology. In this study, we aimed to develop an in silico pipeline designing an mRNA vaccine of the CA-125 neoantigen against breast and ovarian cancer, respectively. Using immuno-bioinformatics tools, we predicted cytotoxic CD8+ T cell epitopes based on somatic mutation-driven neoantigens of CA-125 in breast or ovarian cancer, constructed a self-adjuvant mRNA vaccine with CD40L and MHC-I -targeting domain to enhance cross-presentation of neoepitopes by dendritic cells. With an in silico ImmSim algorithm, we estimated the immune responses post-immunization, showing IFN-γ and CD8+ T cell response. The strategy described in this study may be scaled up and implemented to design precision multi-epitope mRNA vaccines by targeting multiple neoantigens. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {CD4+ T cells play key roles in a range of immune responses, either as direct effectors or through accessory cells, including CD8+ T lymphocytes. In cancer, neoantigen (NeoAg)-specific CD8+ T cells capable of direct tumor recognition have been extensively studied, whereas the role of NeoAg-specific CD4+ T cells is less well understood. We have characterized the murine CD4+ T cell response against a validated NeoAg (CLTCH129>Q) expressed by the MHC-II-deficient squamous cell carcinoma tumor model (SCC VII) at the level of single T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes and in the setting of adoptive immunotherapy. We find that the natural CLTCH129>Q-specific repertoire is diverse and contains TCRs with distinct avidities as measured by tetramer-binding assays and CD4 dependence. Despite these differences, CD4+ T cells expressing high or moderate avidity TCRs undergo comparable in vivo proliferation to cross-presented antigen from growing tumors and drive similar levels of therapeutic immunity that is dependent on CD8+ T cells and CD40L signaling. Adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) with NeoAg-specific CD4+ T cells is most effective when TCR-engineered cells are differentiated ex vivo with IL-7 and IL-15 rather than IL-2 and this was associated with both increased expansion as well as the acquisition and stable maintenance of a T stem cell memory (TSCM)-like phenotype in tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLNs). ACT with TSCM-like CD4+ T cells results in lower PD-1 expression by CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment and an increased frequency of PD-1+CD8+ T cells in tdLNs. These findings illuminate the role of NeoAg-specific CD4+ T cells in mediating antitumor immunity via providing help to CD8+ T cells and highlight their therapeutic potential in ACT. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In personalized cancer immunotherapy, developing an effective neoantigen nanovaccine with high immunogenicity is a significant challenge. Traditional nanovaccine delivery systems often require nanocarriers, which can hinder the delivery of the neoantigen and cause significant toxicity. In this study, we present an innovative strategy of carrier-free nanovaccine achieved through direct self-assembly of 2′-fluorinated CpG (2′F-CpG) with melanoma neoantigen peptide (Obsl1). Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the introduction of a fluorine atom into CpG increases the noncovalent interaction between 2′F-CpG and Obsl1, which enhanced the loading of Obsl1 on 2′F-CpG, resulting in the spontaneous formation of a hybrid 2′F-CpG/Obsl1 nanovaccine. This nanovaccine without extra nanocarriers showed ultrahigh Obsl1 loading up to 83.19 wt %, increasing the neoantigen peptide uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In C57BL/6 mice models, we demonstrated the long-term preventive and therapeutic effects of the prepared 2′F-CpG/Obsl1 nanovaccine against B16F10 melanoma. Immunocellular analysis revealed that the nanovaccine activated innate and adaptive immune responses to cancer cells. Hence, this study established a simple, safe, and effective preparation strategy for a carrier-free neoantigen nanovaccine, which could be adapted for the future design of personalized cancer vaccines in clinical settings. © 2023 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Background Cellular immunotherapies using autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can induce durable regression of epithelial cancers in selected patients with treatment-refractory metastatic disease. As the genetic engineering of T cells with tumor-reactive T-cell receptors (TCRs) comes to the forefront of clinical investigation, the rapid, scalable, and cost-effective detection of patient-specific neoantigen-reactive TIL remains a top priority. Methods We analyzed the single-cell transcriptomic states of 31 neoantigen-specific T-cell clonotypes to identify cell surface dysfunction markers that best identified the metastatic transcriptional states enriched with antitumor TIL. We developed an efficient method to capture neoantigen-reactive TCRs directly from resected human tumors based on cell surface co-expression of CD39, programmed cell death protein-1, and TIGIT dysfunction markers (CD8 + TIL TP). Results TIL TP TCR isolation achieved a high degree of correlation with single-cell transcriptomic signatures that identify neoantigen-reactive TCRs, making it a cost-effective strategy using widely available resources. Reconstruction of additional TIL TP TCRs from tumors identified known and novel antitumor TCRs, showing that at least 39.5% of TIL TP TCRs are neoantigen-reactive or tumor-reactive. Despite their substantial enrichment for neoantigen-reactive TCR clonotypes, clonal dynamics of 24 unique antitumor TIL TP clonotypes from four patients indicated that most in vitro expanded TIL TP populations failed to demonstrate neoantigen reactivity, either by loss of neoantigen-reactive clones during TIL expansion, or through functional impairment during cognate neoantigen recognition. Conclusions While direct usage of in vitro-expanded CD8 + TIL TP as a source for cellular therapy might be precluded by profound TIL dysfunction, isolating TIL TP represents a streamlined effective approach to rapidly identify neoantigen-reactive TCRs to design engineered cellular immunotherapies against cancer.  © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2023.

	abstract = {Neoantigen vaccines have achieved good therapeutic effects in animal experiments and early clinical trials on certain malignant tumors. However, their overall objective effectiveness in clinical trials still needs to be improved. Low-efficiency dendritic cell (DC) migration (<5%) to lymph nodes is one of the factors that limits vaccine effectiveness. For neoantigen vaccines, improving the homing efficiency of DCs is expected to further improve the immunotherapeutic effect. In this study, we used a-D-glucose-1,6biphosphate (a-D-Glu), a metabolite that successfully enhanced C57BL/6J mouse bone marrow-derived DC homing induced by neoantigen peptide, mRNA, and DC vaccines during the administration process and improved the antitumor effects in the mouse C57BL/6J model with a neoantigen vaccine. We clarified that a-D-Glu activated MAPK8IP1 by inhibiting the expression of microRNA-10a-5p, thereby activating the MAPK signaling pathway to promote DC homing. Excitingly, the efficiency of a-D-Glu in promoting DC migration is not weaker than that of PGE2, which is the gold standard used to promote DC migration in clinical trials of DC vaccines. Thus, this study lays the foundation for further enhancing the objective clinical response rate of neoantigen vaccines and overcoming the limitation of an insufficient clinical response rate for neoantigen vaccines caused by low DC homing efficiency.

	abstract = {Background: Although significant progress has been made in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment of advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), most patients still experience acquired drug resistance. Methods: We used a dendritic cell-based neoantigen vaccine combined with ICIs to treat advanced SqCC in a PD-1 blockade-resistant patient. Results: The follow-up of this patient after 12 months revealed significant tumor regression. We also identified a new JAK1 ICI-resistant mutation that could become a potential universal neoantigen target for tumor vaccines. Conclusion: Individualized management of advanced SqCC through a combined neoantigen vaccine and ICI administration could yield beneficial clinical outcomes. Vaccines targeting anti-PD-1-resistant JAK1 mutations might be of particular benefit to a specific group of solid tumor patients.  © 2023 Future Medicine Ltd.},

Among them, cancer vaccines have recently been rapidly developed. Based on tumor-specific antigens referred to as neoantigens, these vaccines can be in various forms such as messenger (m)RNA and synthetic peptides to activate cytotoxic T cells and act with or without dendritic cells. Growing evidence suggests that neoantigen-based cancer vaccines possess a very promising future, yet the processes of immune recognition and activation to relay identification of a neoantigen through the histocompatibility complex (MHC) and T-cell receptor (TCR) remain unclear.

	abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal type of adult brain cancer. Current GBM standard of care, including radiotherapy, often ends up with cancer recurrence, resulting in limited long-term survival benefits for GBM patients. Immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), has thus far shown limited clinical benefit for GBM patients. Therapeutic vaccines hold great potential to elicit anti-cancer adaptive immunity, which can be synergistically combined with ICB and radiotherapy. Peptide vaccines are attractive for their ease of manufacturing and stability, but their therapeutic efficacy has been limited due to poor vaccine co-delivery and the limited ability of monovalent antigen vaccines to prevent tumor immune evasion. To address these challenges, here, we report GBM radioimmunotherapy that combines radiotherapy, ICB, and multivalent lymph-node-targeting adjuvant/antigen-codelivering albumin-binding vaccines (AAco-AlbiVax). Specifically, to codeliver peptide neoantigens and adjuvant CpG to lymph nodes (LNs), we developed AAco-AlbiVax based on a Y-shaped DNA scaffold that was site-specifically conjugated with CpG, peptide neoantigens, and albumin-binding maleimide-modified Evans blue derivative (MEB). As a result, these vaccines elicited antitumor immunity including neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses in mice. In orthotopic GBM mice, the combination of AAco-AlbiVax, ICB, and fractionated radiation enhanced GBM therapeutic efficacy. However, radioimmunotherapy only trended more efficacious over radiotherapy alone. Taken together, these studies underscore the great potential of radioimmunotherapy for GBM, and future optimization of treatment dosing and scheduling would improve the therapeutic efficacy. © The author(s).},

	abstract = {Patients with antibody deficiency disorders, such as primary immunodeficiency (PID) or secondary immunodeficiency (SID) to B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (B-CLPD), are two groups vulnerable to developing the severe or chronic form of coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). The data on adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 are well described in healthy donors, but still limited in patients with antibody deficiency of a different cause. Herein, we analyzed spike-specific IFN-γ and anti-spike IgG antibody responses at 3 to 6 months after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 derived from vaccination and/or infection in two cohorts of immunodeficient patients (PID vs. SID) compared to healthy controls (HCs). Pre-vaccine anti-SARS-CoV-2 cellular responses before vaccine administration were measured in 10 PID patients. Baseline cellular responses were detectable in 4 out of 10 PID patients who had COVID-19 prior to vaccination, perceiving an increase in cellular responses after two-dose vaccination (p < 0.001). Adequate specific cellular responses were observed in 18 out of 20 (90%) PID patients, in 14 out of 20 (70%) SID patients and in 74 out of 81 (96%) HCs after vaccination (and natural infection in some cases). Specific IFN-γ response was significantly higher in HC with respect to PID (1908.5 mUI/mL vs. 1694.1 mUI/mL; p = 0.005). Whereas all SID and HC patients mounted a specific humoral immune response, only 80% of PID patients showed positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was significantly lower in SID compared with HC patients (p = 0.040), without significant differences between PID and HC patients (p = 0.123) and between PID and SID patients (p =0.683). High proportions of PID and SID patients showed adequate specific cellular responses to receptor binding domain (RBD) neoantigen, with a divergence between the two arms of the adaptive immune response in PID and SID patients. We also focused on the correlation of protection of positive SARS-CoV-2 cellular response to omicron exposure: 27 out of 81 (33.3%) HCs referred COVID-19 detected by PCR or antigen test, 24 with a mild course, 1 with moderate symptoms and the remaining 2 with bilateral pneumonia that were treated in an outpatient basis. Our results might support the relevance of these immunological studies to determine the correlation of protection with severe disease and for deciding the need for additional boosters on a personalized basis. Follow-up studies are required to evaluate the duration and variability in the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination or infection. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background CD8 + tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are often observed in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). However, the characteristics of CD8 + TILs, especially T-cell populations specific for tumor antigens, remain poorly understood. Methods High throughput single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing were performed on CD8 + TILs from three surgically-resected lung cancer specimens. Dimensional reduction for clustering was performed using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection. CD8 + TIL TCR specific for the cancer/testis antigen KK-LC-1 and for predicted neoantigens were investigated. Differentially-expressed gene analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and single sample GSEA was performed to characterize antigen-specific T cells. Results A total of 6998 CD8 + T cells was analyzed, divided into 10 clusters according to their gene expression profile. An exhausted T-cell (exhausted T (Tex)) cluster characterized by the expression of ENTPD1 (CD39), TOX, PDCD1 (PD1), HAVCR2 (TIM3) and other genes, and by T-cell oligoclonality, was identified. The Tex TCR repertoire (Tex-TCRs) contained nine different TCR clonotypes recognizing five tumor antigens including a KK-LC-1 antigen and four neoantigens. By re-clustering the tumor antigen-specific T cells (n=140), it could be seen that the individual T-cell clonotypes were present on cells at different stages of differentiation and functional states even within the same Tex cluster. Stimulating these T cells with predicted cognate peptide indicated that TCR signal strength and subsequent T-cell proliferation and cytokine production was variable but always higher for neoantigens than KK-LC-1. Conclusions Our approach focusing on T cells with an exhausted phenotype among CD8 + TILs may facilitate the identification of tumor antigens and clarify the nature of the antigen-specific T cells to specify the promising immunotherapeutic targets in patients with NSCLC.  © 2023 BioMed Central Ltd..

	abstract = {Neoantigen is a protein produced by mutant gene, which is only expressed in tumor cells. It is an ideal target for therapeutic tumor vaccines. Although synthetic long peptide (SLP)-based neoantigen vaccine, DNA-based neoantigen vaccine, and mRNA-based neoantigen vaccine are all in the development stage, they have some inherent shortcomings. Therefore, researchers turned their attention to a new type of “non-coding RNA (ncRNA)”, circular RNA (circRNA), for potential better choice. Because of its unique high stability and protein-coding capacity, circRNA is a promising target in the field of neoantigen vaccine. In this paper, we reviewed the feasibility of circRNA encoding neoantigens, summarized the construction process, explained the mechanism of circRNA vaccine in vitro, and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of circRNA vaccine and possible combination with other immunotherapies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Neoantigen vaccines are one of the most effective immunotherapies for personalized tumour treatment. The current immunogen design of neoantigen vaccines is usually based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and bioinformatics prediction that focuses on the prediction of binding affinity between peptide and MHC molecules, ignoring other peptide-presenting related steps. This may result in a gap between high prediction accuracy and relatively low clinical effectiveness. In this study, we designed an integrated in-silico pipeline, Neo-intline, which started from the SNPs and indels of the tumour samples to simulate the presentation process of peptides in-vivo through an integrated calculation model. Validation on the benchmark dataset of TESLA and clinically validated neoantigens illustrated that neo-intline could outperform current state-of-the-art tools on both sample level and melanoma level. Furthermore, by taking the mouse melanoma model as an example, we verified the effectiveness of 20 neoantigens, including 10 MHC-I and 10 MHC-II peptides. The in-vitro and in-vivo experiments showed that both peptides predicted by Neo-intline could recruit corresponding CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells to induce a T-cell-mediated cellular immune response. Moreover, although the therapeutic effect of neoantigen vaccines alone is not sufficient, combinations with other specific therapies, such as broad-spectrum immune-enhanced adjuvants of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), or immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, can illustrate significant anticancer effects on melanoma. Neo-intline can be used as a benchmark process for the design and screening of immunogenic targets for neoantigen vaccines. © 2023, West China Hospital, Sichuan University.},

	abstract = {Cancer immunotherapies, in particular checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (CBT), can induce control of cancer growth, with a fraction of patients experiencing durable responses. However, the majority of patients currently do not respond to CBT and the molecular determinants of resistance have not been fully elucidated. Mounting clinical evidence suggests that the clonal status of neoantigens (NeoAg) impacts the anti-tumor T cell response. High intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), where the majority of NeoAgs are expressed subclonally, is correlated with poor clinical response to CBT and poor infiltration with tumor-reactive T cells. However, the mechanism by which ITH blunts tumor-reactive T cells is unclear. We developed a transplantable murine lung cancer model to characterize the immune response against a defined set of NeoAgs expressed either clonally or subclonally to model low or high ITH, respectively. Here we show that clonal expression of a weakly immunogenic NeoAg with a relatively strong NeoAg increased the immunogenicity of tumors with low but not high ITH. Mechanistically we determined that clonal NeoAg expression allowed cross-presenting dendritic cells to acquire and present both NeoAgs. Dual NeoAg presentation by dendritic cells was associated with a more mature DC phenotype and a higher stimulatory capacity. These data suggest that clonal NeoAg expression can induce more potent anti-tumor responses due to more stimulatory dendritic cell:T cell interactions. Therapeutic vaccination targeting subclonally expressed NeoAgs could be used to boost anti-tumor T cell responses. © Nguyen et al.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Neoantigens produced from mutations in tumors are important targets of T-cell-based immunotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade has been approved for treating multiple solid tumors. We investigated the potential benefit of adoptive neoantigen-reactive T (NRT) cells in combination with programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor (anti-PD1) for treating lung cancer in a mouse model. Methods: NRT cells were prepared by co-culturing T cells and neoantigen-RNA vaccine-induced dendritic cells. Then, adoptive NRT cells in combination with anti-PD1 were administered to tumor-bearing mice. Pre- and post-therapy cytokine secretion, antitumor efficacy, and tumor microenvironment (TME) changes were determined both in vitro and in vivo. Results: We successfully generated NRT cells based on the 5 neoantigen epitopes identified in this study. NRT cells exhibited an enhanced cytotoxic phenotype in vitro and the combination therapy led to attenuated tumor growth. In addition, this combination strategy downregulated the expression of the inhibitory marker PD‐1 on tumor-infiltrating T cells and promoted the trafficking of tumor-specific T cells to the tumor sites. Conclusion: The adoptive transfer of NRT cells in association with anti-PD1 therapy can exert an antitumor effect on lung cancer, and is a feasible, effective, and novel immunotherapy regimen for treating solid tumors. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Precision immunotherapy, driven by genomic and bioinformatic advancements, has emerged as a promising and viable approach to combat cancer. Targeting neoantigens offers the advantage of specific immune responses with minimal off-tumor toxicity. In this study, we investigated the potential of adoptive T cells activated by HLA-restricted neoantigen peptides from driver gene mutations for treating cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a highly aggressive cancer with poor prognosis and high mortality rates. Through whole exome sequencing of CCA cell lines, KKU-213A and KKU-100, we identified mutations in common driver genes and predicted corresponding HLA-restricted peptides. Peptides from KRAS, RNF43, and TP53 mutations exhibited strong binding affinity to HLA-A11, as validated through molecular docking and T2-cell binding assays. Dendritic cells (DCs) from healthy donors expressing HLA-A* 11:01, pulsed with individual or pooled peptides, showed comparable levels of costimulatory molecules (CD11c, CD40, CD86, and HLA-DR) to conventional DCs but higher expression of maturation markers, CD80 and CD86. Autologous HLA-A* 11:01-restricted T cells, activated by peptide-pulsed DCs, effectively lysed KKU-213A (HLA-A*11:01) cells, outperforming conventional tumor lysate-pulsed DCs. This effect was specific to HLA-A* 11:01-restricted T cells and not observed in KKU-100 (HLA-A*33:03) cells. Moreover, HLA-A* 11:01-restricted T cells exhibited elevated levels of IFN-gamma, granulysin, and granzyme B, indicating their potent anti-tumor capabilities. These findings underscore the specificity and efficiency of HLA-A* 11:01-restricted T cells targeting KRAS, RNF43, TP53 mutated CCA cells, and offer valuable insights for developing immunotherapeutic strategies and therapeutic peptide-vaccines for CCA treatment. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Individualized immunotherapy has attracted great attention due to its high specificity, effectiveness, and safety. We used an exogenous antigen to label tumor cells with MHC I molecules, which allowed neoantigen-specific T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells. A neoantigen vaccine alone cannot achieve complete tumor clearance due to a tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The LightOn system was developed to effectively eliminate tumor cells through the spatiotemporally controllable expression of diphtheria toxin A fragment, leading to antigen release in the tumor region. These antigens stimulated and enhanced immunological function and thus, recruited neoantigen-specific T cells to infiltrate tumor tissue. Using the nanoparticle delivery system, neoantigens produced higher delivery efficiency to lymph nodes and improved tumor targeting ability for tumor cell labelling. Good tumor inhibition and prolonged survival were achieved, while eliciting a strong immune response. The combination of a spatiotemporally controllable transgene system with tumor neoantigen labeling has great potential for tumor immunotherapy. © 2022},

Here, a personalized neoantigen nanovaccine (PNVAC) platform for adjuvant cancer immunotherapy is generated. PNVAC triggers superior protective efficacy against tumor recurrence and promotes longer survival than free neoantigens, especially when combined with anti-PD-1 treatment in a murine tumor model. A phase I clinical trial (ChiCTR1800017319) is initiated to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and prophylactic effect of PNVAC on preventing tumor recurrence in patients with high-risk gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer after adjuvant chemotherapy of postsurgical resection. The one- and two-year disease-free survival rates are significantly higher than historical record. PNVAC induces both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses as well as antigen-experienced memory T cell phenotype. Furthermore, the immune response is persistent and remains evident one year after the vaccination.

Further, the combination of Neo-NVs and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) produces significant inhibition on postsurgical tumor recurrence and metastasis and induces a long-lasting immune memory. In conclusion, the study provides a simple and reliable strategy for rapid preparing personalized neoantigens-based cancer vaccines and engaging checkpoint treatment to restore the capability of tumor immune surveillance and clearance in surgical patients. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

	abstract = {In recent years, immunotherapy has finally found its place in the anti-cancer therapeutic arsenal, even becoming standard of care as first line treatment for metastatic forms. The clinical benefit provided by checkpoint blockers such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in many cancers revolutionized the field. However, too many patients remain refractory to these treatments due to weak baseline anti-cancer immunity. There is therefore a need to boost the frequency and function of patients’ cytotoxic CD8+ cellular effectors by targeting immunogenic and tumor-restricted antigens, such as neoantigens using an efficient vaccination platform. Dendritic cells (DC) are the most powerful immune cell subset for triggering cellular immune response. However, autologous DC-based vaccines display several limitations, such as the lack of reproducibility and the limited number of cells that can be manufactured. Here we discuss the advantages of a new therapeutic vaccine based on an allogeneic Plasmacytoid DC cell line, which is easy to produce and represents a powerful platform for priming and expanding anti-neoantigen cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells. © 2023 Hannani et al.},

We propose a simple model including key elements of cancer-immune interactions and conduct a phase plane analysis to understand the immunological mechanisms of cancer neoantigen vaccines. Analytical results are obtained for two widely used functional forms that represent the killing rate of tumor cells by immune cells: the law of mass action (LMA) and the dePillis-Radunskaya Law (LPR). Using the LMA, our results reveal that a slowly growing tumor can escape the immune surveillance and that there is a unique periodic solution. The LPR offers richer dynamics, in which tumor elimination and uncontrolled tumor growth are both present. We show that tumor elimination requires sufficient number of initial activated T cells in relationship to the malignant cells, which lends support to using the neoantigen cancer vaccine as an adjuvant therapy after the primary tumor is surgically removed or treated using radiotherapy. We also derive a sufficient condition for uncontrolled tumor growth under the assumption of the LPR. The juxtaposition of analyses with these two different choices for the killing rate function highlights their importance on model behavior and biological implications, by which we hope to spur further theoretical and experimental work to understand mechanisms underlying different functional forms for the killing rate. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Cancer vaccine represents a promising strategy toward personalized immunotherapy, and its therapeutic potency highly relies on the specificity of tumor antigens. Among these extensively studied tumor antigens, neoantigens, a type of short synthetic peptides derived from random somatic mutations, have been shown to be able to elicit tumor-specific antitumor immune response for tumor suppression. However, challenges remain in the efficient and safe delivery of neoantigens to antigen-presenting cells inside lymph nodes for eliciting potent and sustained antitumor immune responses. The rapid advance of biomaterials including various nanomaterials, injectable hydrogels, and macroscopic scaffolds has been found to hold great promises to facilitate the construction of efficient cancer vaccines attributing to their high loading and controllable release capacities. Areas covered: In this review, we will summarize and discuss the recent advances in the utilization of different types of biomaterials to construct neoantigen-based cancer vaccines, followed by a simple perspective on the future development of such biomaterial-assisted cancer neoantigen vaccination and personalized immunotherapy. Expert opinion: These latest progresses in biomaterial-assisted cancer vaccinations have shown great promises in boosting substantially potentiated tumor-specific antitumor immunity to suppress tumor growth, thus preventing tumor metastasis and recurrence. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Background Expression of CD103 and CD39 has been found to pinpoint tumor-reactive CD8 + T cells in a variety of solid cancers. We aimed to investigate whether these markers specifically identify neoantigen-specific T cells in colorectal cancers (CRCs) with low mutation burden. Experimental design Whole-exome and RNA sequencing of 11 mismatch repair-proficient (MMR-proficient) CRCs and corresponding healthy tissues were performed to determine the presence of putative neoantigens. In parallel, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were cultured from the tumor fragments and, in parallel, CD8 + T cells were flow-sorted from their respective tumor digests based on single or combined expression of CD103 and CD39. Each subset was expanded and subsequently interrogated for neoantigen-directed reactivity with synthetic peptides. Neoantigen-directed reactivity was determined by flow cytometric analyses of T cell activation markers and ELISA-based detection of IFN-γand granzyme B release. Additionally, imaging mass cytometry was applied to investigate the localization of CD103 + CD39 + cytotoxic T cells in tumors. Results Neoantigen-directed reactivity was only encountered in bulk TIL populations and CD103 + CD39 + (double positive, DP) CD8 + T cell subsets but never in double-negative or single-positive subsets. Neoantigen-reactivity detected in bulk TIL but not in DP CD8 + T cells could be attributed to CD4 + T cells. CD8 + T cells that were located in direct contact with cancer cells in tumor tissues were enriched for CD103 and CD39 expression. Conclusion Coexpression of CD103 and CD39 is characteristic of neoantigen-specific CD8 + T cells in MMR-proficient CRCs with low mutation burden. The exploitation of these subsets in the context of adoptive T cell transfer or engineered T cell receptor therapies is a promising avenue to extend the benefits of immunotherapy to an increasing number of CRC patients.  © 2023 BioMed Central Ltd..

	abstract = {Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is a measure to predict patient responsiveness to immune checkpoint immunotherapy because with increased mutation frequency, the likelihood of a greater neoantigen burden is increased. Although neoantigen prediction tools exist, tumor neoantigen burden has not been adopted as a measure to predict immunotherapy response. With both measures, current guidelines are limited to the coding regions, but ectopic expression of sequences in the noncoding space may potentially be a source of neoantigens. A pan-cancer cohort of 574 advanced disease stage patients with whole genome and transcriptome sequencing was analyzed to report mutation burden and neoantigen counts within the coding and noncoding regions. The efficacy of tumor neoantigen burden, reported as tumor neoantigen count (TNC), including neoantigens derived from the expression of noncoding regions, compared with TMB as a predictor of response to immunotherapy for 80 patients who had received treatment, was evaluated. TMB was found to be the best predictor of response to immunotherapy, whereas expression-derived TNC from the noncoding regions did not improve prediction of response. Therefore, there is minimal benefit in extending the calculation of TNC to the noncoding space for the purposes of predicting response. However, it is likely that there is a wealth of neoantigens derived from the noncoding space that may impact patient outcomes and treatments. © 2022 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for Investigative Pathology},

	abstract = {Background: Small peptides encoded by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have attracted attention for their various functions. Recent studies indicate that these small peptides participate in immune responses and antigen presentation. However, the significance of RNA modifications remains unclear. Methods: Thirteen non-m6A-related neoantigen-coding lncRNAs were selected for analysis from the TransLnc database. Next, a neoantigen activation score (NAS) model was established based on the characteristics of the lncRNAs. Machine learning was employed to expand the model to two additional RNA-seq and two single-cell sequencing datasets for further validation. The DLpTCR algorithm was used to predict T cell receptor (TCR)-peptide binding probability. Results: The non-m6A-related NAS model predicted patients’ overall survival outcomes more precisely than the m6A-related NAS model. Furthermore, the non-m6A-related NAS was positively correlated with tumor cells’ evolutionary level, immune infiltration, and antigen presentation. However, high NAS gliomas also showed more PD-L1 expression and high mutation frequencies of T-cell positive regulators. Interestingly, results of intercellular communication analysis suggest that T cell-high neoplastic cell interaction is weaker in both of the NAS groups which might arise from decreased IFNGR1 expression. Moreover, we identified unique TCR-peptide pairs present in all glioma samples based on peptides encoded by the 13 selected lncRNAs. And increased levels of neoantigen-active TCR patterns were found in high NAS gliomas. Conclusions: Our work suggests that non-m6A-related neoantigen-coding lncRNAs play an essential role in glioma progression and that screened TCR clonotypes might provide potential avenues for chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy for gliomas. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Immunotherapy is currently recognized as the fourth modality in cancer therapy. CTL can detect cancer cells via complexes involving human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules and peptides derived from tumor antigens, resulting in antigen-specific cancer rejection. The peptides may be predicted in silico using machine learning-based algorithms. Neopeptides, derived from neoantigens encoded by somatic mutations in cancer cells, are putative immunotherapy targets, as they have high tumor specificity and immunogenicity. Here, we used our pipeline to select 278 neoepitopes with high predictive “SCORE” from the tumor tissues of 46 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or metastasis of colorectal carcinoma. We validated peptide immunogenicity and specificity by in vivo vaccination with HLA-A2, A24, B35, and B07 transgenic mice using ELISpot assay, in vitro and in vivo killing assays. We statistically evaluated the power of our prediction algorithm and demonstrated the capacity of our pipeline to predict neopeptides (area under the curve = 0.687, P < 0.0001). We also analyzed the potential of long peptides containing the predicted neoepitopes to induce CTLs. Our study indicated that the short peptides predicted using our algorithm may be intrinsically present in tumor cells as cleavage products of long peptides. Thus, we empirically demonstrated that the accuracy and specificity of our prediction tools may be potentially improved in vivo using the HLA transgenic mouse model. Our data will help to design feedback algorithms to improve in silico prediction, potentially allowing researchers to predict peptides for personalized immunotherapy. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain cancer diagnosed and still carry a poor prognosis despite aggressive multimodal management. Despite the continued advances in immunotherapy for other cancer types, however, there remain no FDA approved immunotherapies for cancers such as glioblastoma. OF the many approaches being explored, cancer vaccine programs are undergoing a renaissance due to the technological advances and personalized nature of their contemporary design. Neoantigen vaccines are a form of immunotherapy involving the use of DNA, mRNA, and proteins derived from non-synonymous mutations identified in patient tumor tissue samples to stimulate tumor-specific T-cell reactivity leading to enhance tumor targeting. In the last several years, the study of neoantigens as a therapeutic target has increased, with the routine workflow implementation of comprehensive next generation sequencing and in silico peptide binding prediction algorithms. Several neoantigen vaccine platforms are being evaluated in clinical trials for malignancies including melanoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and glioblastoma, among others. In this review, we will review the concept of neoantigen discovery using cancer immunogenomics approaches in glioblastoma and explore the disease-specific issues being addressed in the design of effective personalized cancer vaccine strategies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Cancer immunoediting1 is a hallmark of cancer2 that predicts that lymphocytes kill more immunogenic cancer cells to cause less immunogenic clones to dominate a population. Although proven in mice1,3, whether immunoediting occurs naturally in human cancers remains unclear. Here, to address this, we investigate how 70 human pancreatic cancers evolved over 10 years. We find that, despite having more time to accumulate mutations, rare long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer who have stronger T cell activity in primary tumours develop genetically less heterogeneous recurrent tumours with fewer immunogenic mutations (neoantigens). To quantify whether immunoediting underlies these observations, we infer that a neoantigen is immunogenic (high-quality) by two features—‘non-selfness’ based on neoantigen similarity to known antigens4,5, and ‘selfness’ based on the antigenic distance required for a neoantigen to differentially bind to the MHC or activate a T cell compared with its wild-type peptide. Using these features, we estimate cancer clone fitness as the aggregate cost of T cells recognizing high-quality neoantigens offset by gains from oncogenic mutations. With this model, we predict the clonal evolution of tumours to reveal that long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer develop recurrent tumours with fewer high-quality neoantigens. Thus, we submit evidence that that the human immune system naturally edits neoantigens. Furthermore, we present a model to predict how immune pressure induces cancer cell populations to evolve over time. More broadly, our results argue that the immune system fundamentally surveils host genetic changes to suppress cancer. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Tumor-specific neoantigens are ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy, but few of these have been identified thus far. An analysis strategy was developed for neoantigen in non-coding regions by RNC (ribosome-nascent chain complex)-RNA-seq in mouse lung cancer. Methods: In LLC (Lewis lung carcinoma) cell lines, RNC extraction, RNC-RNA extraction, RNC-RNA seq and bioinformatics analysis were carried out. The immunogenicity and specificity were determined by immunizing mice. Results: Twenty neoantigens were identified from non-coding regions. Seventeen long peptides were synthesized successfully and 5/17 of these neoantigens were found to be immunogenic. In tumor transplant models, the non-coding neoantigen vaccines immunization achieved in vivo tumor control in protective and therapeutic settings. Conclusions: In mice, the non-coding neoantigen vaccines can provoke anti-tumour effect against lung cancer. This can form the basis for future study of RNC-RNA-seq, as a method to identify non-coding neoantigens. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Biolife Sas.},

	abstract = {Background. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant primary brain tumor in adults. Despite maximal treatment, median survival remains dismal at 14–24 months. Immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibition, have revolutionized management of some cancers but have little benefit for GBM patients.This is, in part, due to the low mutational and neoantigen burden in this immunogenically “cold” tumor. Methods. U87MG and patient-derived cell lines were treated with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC) and underwent whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing. Cell lines were then subjected to cellular assays with neoantigen and cancer testis antigen (CTA) specificT cells. Results. WedemonstratethatDACincreasesneoantigenandCTAmRNAexpressionthroughDNAhypomethylation. This results in increased neoantigen presentation by MHC class I in tumor cells, leading to increased neoantigen- and CTA-specificT-cell activation and killing of DAC-treated cancer cells. In addition, we show that patients have endogenous cancer-specificT cells in both tumor and blood, which show increased tumor-specific activation in the presence of DAC-treated cells. Conclusions. Our work shows that DAC increases GBM immunogenicity and consequent susceptibility toT-cell responses in vitro. Our results support a potential use of DAC as a sensitizing agent for immunotherapy. © The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Neuro-Oncology.},

	abstract = {Background: Only a minority of patients clinically benefit from immune checkpoint therapy. Tumor clones with neoantigens have immunogenicity; therefore, they are eliminated by T-cell-mediated immune editing. Identifying neoantigen clones with the ability to induce immune elimination may better predict the clinical outcome of immunotherapy. Methods: We developed ioTNL model, which indicates the immunoediting-based optimized tumor neoantigen load, by identifying tumor clones that could induce immune elimination. Data of more than two hundred patients from our patient pool and previously reported studies who underwent anti-PD-(L)1 therapy were collected to validate the prediction performance of ioTNL model. Clonal architectures, immune editing scores and ioTNL scores were identified. The association between the response as well as prognosis and the ioTNL were evaluated. Panel sequencing of genes from 2,469 patients within 20 cancer types was performed to profile the landscape of immunoediting. Results: As expected, the ioTNL score could predict the response in patients who underwent immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) immunotherapy for various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; p = 0.0066), skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM; p = 0.026) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC; p = 0.0025). Patients with a high ioTNL score demonstrated longer survival than those with a low score. We verified the ioTNL on our cohort through panel sequencing and found that the ioTNL was associated with the response (p = 0.025) and prognosis (p = 0.00082) in anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy. In addition, we found that the immune editing score correlated with the tumor mutation burden (TMB) and the objective response rate of immunotherapy. Conclusions: Identifying neoantigen clones with the ability to induce immune elimination would better predict the efficacy of immunotherapy. We have proved that the reliable method of ioTNL can be applied to whole-exome sequencing (WES) and panel data and would have a broad application in precision diagnosis in immunotherapy. © 2022.

We used single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor sequences to identify signatures and functional correlates of tumor-specific CD4+ T cells infiltrating human melanoma. Conventional CD4+ T cells that recognize tumor neoantigens express CXCL13 and are subdivided into clusters expressing memory and T follicular helper markers, and those expressing cytolytic markers, inhibitory receptors, and IFN-γ. The frequency of CXCL13+ CD4+ T cells in the tumor correlated with the transcriptional states of CD8+ T cells and macrophages, maturation of B cells, and patient survival.

	abstract = {Neoantigen-directed therapy lacks preclinical models recapitulating neoantigen characteristics of original tumors. It is urgent to develop a platform to assess T cell response for neoantigen screening. Here, immunogenic potential of neoantigen-peptides of tumor tissues and matched organoids (n = 27 pairs) are analyzed by Score tools with whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-class-I algorithms. The comparisons between 9203 predicted neoantigen-peptides from 2449 mutations of tumor tissues and 9991 ones from 2637 mutations of matched organoids demonstrate that organoids preserved majority of genetic features, HLA alleles, and similar neoantigen landscape of original tumors. Higher neoantigen load is observed in tumors with early stage. Multiomics analysis combining WGS, RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, mass spectrometry filters out 93 candidate neoantigen-peptides with strong immunogenic potential for functional validation in five organoids. Immunogenic peptides are defined by inducing increased CD107aCD137IFN-γ expressions and IFN-γ secretion of CD8 cells in flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assays. Nine immunogenic peptides shared by at least two individuals are validated, including peptide from TP53R90S. Organoid killing assay confirms the antitumor activity of validated immunogenic peptide-reactive CD8 cells, which is further enhanced in the presence of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The study characterizes HLA-class-I neoantigen landscape in hepatobiliary tumor, providing practical strategy with tumor organoid model for neoantigen-peptide identification in personalized immunotherapy. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Introduction: Factors underlying antitumor immunity in pancreatic cancer (PC) are poorly understood. We hypothesized that not neoantigen quantity, but quality, is related to immune cell infiltration and survival. Methodology: We performed genomic and transcriptomic profiling of paired normal, tumor tissue of 13 patients with PC with distinct survival times. Additionally, neoantigens prediction and immunological profiling were performed. Results: The proportion of neoantigens with a low similarity-to-self score was higher in short-term survivors (p < 0.0001), while mutational load and burden, similarity-to-known-pathogens, and immunogenicity of neoantigens were not associated with immune cell infiltration or survival. Discussion: No tumor mutational load or neoantigen quantity, but low similarity-to-self score, was associated with immune cell infiltration and survival.

	abstract = {Neoantigen vaccines aiming to induce tumor-specific T cell responses have achieved promising antitumor effects in early clinical trials. However, the underlying mechanism regarding response or resistance to this treatment is unclear. Here we observe that neoantigen vaccine-generated T cells can synergize with the immune checkpoint blockade for effective tumor control. Specifically, we performed single-cell sequencing on over 100,000 T cells and uncovered that combined therapy induces an antigen-specific CD8 T cell population with active chemokine signaling (Cxcr3+/Ccl5+), lower co-inhibitory receptor expression (Lag3−/Havcr2−) and higher cytotoxicity (Fasl+/Gzma+). Furthermore, generation of neoantigen-specific T cells in the draining lymph node is required for combination treatment. Signature genes of this unique population are associated with T cell clonal frequency and better survival in humans. Our study profiles the dynamics of tumor-infiltrating T cells during neoantigen vaccine and immune checkpoint blockade treatments and high-dimensionally identifies neoantigen-reactive T cell signatures for future development of therapeutic strategies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background. The effectiveness of cancer neoantigen peptide vaccines depends on the presence of an adjuvant in their composition. Poly(I:C), a TRL-3 agonist, is used as an adjuvant in mouse models of cancer vaccines, but has limitations for use in humans. Therefore, the search for new effective adjuvants for inclusion in the composition of cancer neoantigen peptide vaccine is relevant. Ridostin Pro is a domestic drug that contains a natural complex of sodium salts of double-chiral and single-chiral ribonucleic acids, is an agonist of TLR-3, an inducer of interferon, its antiviral activity is shown. In this regard, the study of Ridostin Pro as an adjuvant in the composition of neoan-tigen peptide vaccines is of interest. Aim. To evaluate the ability of Ridostin Pro and Poly(I:C) adjuvants enhance the specific T-cell response to neo-antigen synthetic peptides; to study the antitumor efficacy of a neoantigen peptide vaccine with Ridostin Pro or Poly(I:C) adjuvants. Materials and methods. Immunogenicity of peptides after vaccination with Ridostin Pro or Poly(I:C) adjuvants evaluated with ELISpot. Antitumor effect of Ridostin Pro or Poly(I:C) adjuvants were evaluated on a mouse model of the B16-F10 tumor by the effect on the tumor growth rate and survival of mice. Results. Vaccination of mice with Ridostin Pro or Poly(I:C) with neoantigen peptides contributed to the appear-ance of a specific immune response to peptides that were part of the vaccine. Ridostin Pro, both as part of a vaccine model and when administered without a peptide, inhibits tumor growth and increases the life expectancy of mice with melanoma B16-F10. Conclusion. Ridostin Pro promotes the formation of a specific immune response to the peptide vaccine, enhances the antitumor effect of the vaccine. These results confirm that Ridostin Pro may prove to be an effective adjuvant for personalized neoantigen peptide vaccines. © 2022, ABV-press Publishing House. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Stage III–IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a devastating disease characterized by a poor prognosis. NSCLC tumors carry genetic mutations, which can lead to the expression of altered protein sequences. Peptides originating from mutated proteins and bound to MHC molecules on the tumor cell surface are referred to as neoantigens, as they are tumor-specific and not expressed in normal cells. Due to their tumor specificity, neoantigens have a strong potential to induce an anti-tumor immune response and have been investigated for development of personalized therapeutic cancer vaccines. The current study describes the development of a clinical grade neoantigen vaccine formulation (FRAME-001) intended as immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab. The detection of aberrant tumor-specific transcripts as well as an algorithm to select immunogenic neoantigen peptides are described. Subsequently, selected neoantigen peptides were synthesized with a high throughput synthesis platform and aseptically formulated under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions into four aqueous peptides mixtures that each contained six neoantigen peptides. A validated stability-indicating analytical method was developed in which we considered the personalized nature of the formulation. An extensive stability study performed either at −25 °C or −80 °C showed that the formulation was stable for up to 32 weeks. The formulation was mixed with the vaccine adjuvant Montanide ISA 51 VG, which yielded the final vaccine emulsion. The stability of the vaccine emulsion was demonstrated using microscopic examination, differential light scattering, and the water-drop test. The presented data show that FRAME-001 is a feasible personalized vaccine formulation for the treatment of stage III–IV NSCLC. The presented data may give guidance in the development of novel personalized therapeutic vaccines since this formulation strategy could be used for any cancer indication. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) has become a promising tool in therapeutic cancer vaccine strategies. Owing to its flexible design and rapid production, mRNA is an attractive antigen delivery format for cancer vaccines targeting mutated peptides expressed in a tumor—the so-called neoantigens. These neoantigens are rarely shared between patients, and inclusion of these antigens in a vaccine requires the production of individual batches of patient-tailored mRNA. The authors have developed MIDRIXNEO, a personalized mRNA-loaded dendritic cell vaccine targeting tumor neoantigens, which is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical study in lung cancer patients. To facilitate this study, the authors set up a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant production process for the manufacture of small batches of personalized neoantigen-encoding mRNA. In this article, the authors describe the complete mRNA production process and the extensive quality assessment to which the mRNA is subjected. Validation runs have shown that the process delivers mRNA of reproducible, high quality. This process is now successfully applied for the production of neoantigen-encoding mRNA for the clinical evaluation of MIDRIXNEO. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that a GMP-based production process of patient-tailored neoantigen mRNA has been described. © 2021 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy},

	abstract = {Neoantigens derived from somatic DNA alterations are ideal cancer-specific targets. In recent years, the combination therapy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockers and neoantigen vaccines has shown clinical efficacy in original PD-1/PD-L1 blocker non-responders. However, not all somatic DNA mutations result in immunogenicity among cancer cells and efficient tools to predict the immunogenicity of neoepitopes are still urgently needed. Here, we present the Seq2Neo pipeline, which provides a one-stop solution for neoepitope feature prediction using raw sequencing data. Neoantigens derived from different types of genome DNA alterations, including point mutations, insertion deletions and gene fusions, are all supported. Importantly, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model was trained to predict the immunogenicity of neoepitopes and this model showed an improved performance compared to the currently available tools in immunogenicity prediction using independent datasets. We anticipate that the Seq2Neo pipeline could become a useful tool in the prediction of neoantigen immunogenicity and cancer immunotherapy. Seq2Neo is open-source software under an academic free license (AFL) v3.0 and is freely available at Github. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) commonly emerges in an immunologically “cold” state, thereafter protects it away from cytolytic attack by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, resulting in poor response to immunotherapy. Herein, an acidic/photo-sensitive dendritic cell (DCs)-based neoantigen nano-vaccine has been explored to convert tumor immune “cold” state into “hot”, and remodel tumor-associated neutrophils to potentiate anticancer immune response for enhancing immunotherapy efficiency. The nano-vaccine is constructed by SiPCCl2-hybridized mesoporous silica with coordination of Fe(III)-captopril, and coating with exfoliated membrane of matured DCs by H22-specific neoantigen stimulation. The nano-vaccines actively target H22 tumors and induce immunological cell death to boost tumor-associated antigen release by the generation of excess 1O2 through photodynamic therapy, which act as in situ tumor vaccination to strengthen antitumor T-cell response against primary H22 tumor growth. Interestingly, the nano-vaccines are also home to lymph nodes to directly induce the activation and proliferation of neoantigen-specific T cells to suppress the primary/distal tumor growth. Moreover, the acidic-triggered captopril release in tumor microenvironment can polarize the protumoral N2 phenotype neutrophils to antitumor N1 phenotype for improving the immune effects to achieve complete tumor regression (83%) in H22-bearing mice and prolong the survival time. This work provides an alternative approach for developing novel HCC immunotherapy strategies. © 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

	abstract = {CD8+ T cell reactivity towards tumor mutation-derived neoantigens is widely believed to facilitate the antitumor immunity induced by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Here we show that broadening in the number of neoantigen-reactive CD8+ T cell (NART) populations between pre-treatment to 3-weeks post-treatment distinguishes patients with controlled disease compared to patients with progressive disease in metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) treated with PD-L1-blockade. The longitudinal analysis of peripheral CD8+ T cell recognition of patient-specific neopeptide libraries consisting of DNA barcode-labelled pMHC multimers in a cohort of 24 patients from the clinical trial NCT02108652 also shows that peripheral NARTs derived from patients with disease control are characterised by a PD1+ Ki67+ effector phenotype and increased CD39 levels compared to bystander bulk- and virus-antigen reactive CD8+ T cells. The study provides insights into NART characteristics following ICB and suggests that early-stage NART expansion and activation are associated with response to ICB in patients with mUC. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background Harnessing the immune system to purposely recognize and destroy tumors represents a significant breakthrough in clinical oncology. Non-synonymous mutations (neoantigenic peptides) were identified as powerful cancer targets. This knowledge can be exploited for further improvements of active immunotherapies, including cancer vaccines, as T cells specific for neoantigens are not attenuated by immune tolerance mechanism and do not harm healthy tissues. The current study aimed at developing an optimized multitarget vaccine using short or long neoantigenic peptides utilizing virus-like particles (VLPs) as an efficient vaccine platform. Methods Mutations of murine mammary carcinoma cells were identified by integrating mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics and whole exome sequencing. Neoantigenic peptides were synthesized and covalently linked to virus-like nanoparticles using a Cu-free click chemistry method for easy preparation of vaccines against mouse mammary carcinoma. Results As compared with short peptides, vaccination with long peptides was superior in the generation of neoantigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, which readily produced interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor-necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The resulting anti-tumor effect was associated with favorable immune re-polarization in the tumor microenvironment through reduction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Vaccination with long neoantigenic peptides also decreased post-surgical tumor recurrence and metastases, and prolonged mouse survival, despite the tumor's low mutational burden. Conclusion Integrating mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics and whole exome sequencing is an efficient approach for identifying neoantigenic peptides. Our multitarget VLP-based vaccine shows a promising anti-tumor effect in an aggressive murine mammary carcinoma model. Future clinical application using this strategy is readily feasible and practical, as click chemistry coupling of personalized synthetic peptides to the nanoparticles can be done at the bedside directly before injection.  © },

Although numerous treatment options are available, current explorations of personalized vaccines have shown potential as promising new treatment options to prevent the recurrence of cancer. Here we present a small proof of concept study using a prophylactic peptide vaccination approach in four female breast cancer patients who achieved remission after standard treatment. The patients were initially analyzed for somatic tumor mutations and then treated with personalized neoantigen-derived peptide vaccines. These vaccines consisted of HLA class I and class II peptides and were administered intracutaneously followed by subcutaneous application of sargramostim and/or topical imiquimod as an immunological adjuvant. After an initial priming phase of four vaccinations within two weeks, patients received monthly boosting/maintenance vaccinations. Chemotherapy or checkpoint inhibition was not performed during vaccination. One patient received hormone therapy. The vaccines were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. All patients displayed vaccine-induced CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-cell responses against various neoantigens. Furthermore, all patients remained tumor-free and had persistent T-cell responses, even several months after the last vaccination, suggesting the potential of peptide vaccines as an immunosurveillance and long term prophylaxis option. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Immunoediting includes three temporally distinct stages, termed elimination, equilibrium, and escape, and has been proposed to explain the interactions between cancer cells and the immune system during the evolution of cancer.However, the status ofimmunoediting in cancer remains unclear, and the existence of neoantigen depletion in untreated cancer has been debated. Here we developed a distribution pattern-based method for quantifying neoantigen-mediated negative selection in cancer evolution. The method can provide a robust and reliable quantification for immunoediting signal in individual patients with cancer. Moreover, thismethod demonstrated the prevalence of immunoediting in the immunotherapy-naive cancer genome. The elimination and escape stages of immunoediting can be quantifiedseparately, where tumor types with strong immunoediting elimination exhibit a weak immunoediting-escape signal, and vice versa. The quantified immunoediting-elimination signal was predictive of clinical response to cancer immunotherapy. Collectively, immunoediting quantification provides an evolutionary perspective for evaluating the antigenicity of neoantigens and reveals a potential biomarker for precision immunotherapy in cancer. Significance: Quantification of neoantigen-mediated negative selection in cancer progression reveals distinct features of cancer immunoediting and can serve as a potential biomarker to predict immunotherapy response. © 2022 American Association for Cancer Research},

	abstract = {Immunotherapy treatments harnessing the immune system herald a new era of personalized medicine, offering considerable benefits for cancer patients. Over the past years, tumor neoantigens emerged as a rising star in immunotherapy. Neoantigens are tumor-specific antigens arising from somatic mutations, which are proceeded and presented by the major histocompatibility complex on the cell surface. With the advancement of sequencing technology and bioinformatics engineering, the recognition of neoantigens has accelerated and is expected to be incorporated into the clinical routine. Currently, tumor vaccines against neoantigens mainly encompass peptides, DNA, RNA, and dendritic cells, which are extremely specific to individual patients. Due to the high immunogenicity of neoantigens, tumor vaccines could activate and expand antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to intensify anti-tumor immunity. Herein, we introduce the origin and prediction of neoantigens and compare the advantages and disadvantages of multiple types of neoantigen vaccines. Besides, we review the immunizations and the current clinical research status in neoantigen vaccines, and outline strategies for enhancing the efficacy of neoantigen vaccines. Finally, we present the challenges facing the application of neoantigens. © The author(s).},

	abstract = {Neoantigen-based tumor vaccines have been applied in patient-specific melanoma-derived immunogenic mutated epitopes (neoantigens), with potential antineoplastic and immunomodulating effects. Yet, their use is limited by different physicochemical properties and poor pharmacokinetics. Herein, we constructed a human serum albumin-based dual adjuvant neoantigen nanovaccine loaded with imiquimod and magnesium. Magnesium, in coordination with imiquimod, could greatly activate dendritic and T cells. After subcutaneous injection, the nanovaccine effectively targeted tumor-draining lymph nodes (LNs) and promoted the presentation of neoantigens, thus generating a large number of effector T cells. In the B16F10 mouse melanoma prevention model, the nanovaccine effectively inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. To sum up, this new neoantigen nanovaccine could be used as a new method for targeting melanoma and may be potentially applied in clinical work. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND. Neoantigen-driven recognition and T cell–mediated killing contribute to tumor clearance following adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Yet how diversity, frequency, and persistence of expanded neoepitope-specific CD8+ T cells derived from TIL infusion products affect patient outcome is not fully determined. METHODS. Using barcoded pMHC multimers, we provide a comprehensive mapping of CD8+ T cells recognizing neoepitopes in TIL infusion products and blood samples from 26 metastatic melanoma patients who received ACT. RESULTS. We identified 106 neoepitopes within TIL infusion products corresponding to 1.8% of all predicted neoepitopes. We observed neoepitope-specific recognition to be virtually devoid in TIL infusion products given to patients with progressive disease outcome. Moreover, we found that the frequency of neoepitope-specific CD8+ T cells in TIL infusion products correlated with increased survival and that neoepitope-specific CD8+ T cells shared with the infusion product in posttreatment blood samples were unique to responders of TIL-ACT. Finally, we found that a transcriptional signature for lymphocyte activity within the tumor microenvironment was associated with a higher frequency of neoepitope-specific CD8+ T cells in the infusion product. CONCLUSIONS. These data support previous case studies of neoepitope-specific CD8+ T cells in melanoma and indicate that successful TIL-ACT is associated with an expansion of neoepitope-specific CD8+ T cells.

	abstract = {Upon chronic antigen exposure, CD8+ T cells become exhausted, acquiring a dysfunctional state correlated with the inability to control infection or tumor progression. In contrast, stem-like CD8+ T progenitors maintain the ability to promote and sustain effective immunity. Adenovirus (Ad)–vectored vaccines encoding tumor neoantigens have been shown to eradicate large tumors when combined with anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (αPD-1) in murine models; however, the mechanisms and translational potential have not yet been elucidated. Here, we show that gorilla Ad vaccine targeting tumor neoepitopes enhances responses to αPD-1 therapy by improving immunogenicity and antitumor efficacy. Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated that the combination of Ad vaccine and αPD-1 increased the number of murine polyfunctional neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells over αPD-1 monotherapy, with an accumulation of Tcf1+ stem-like progenitors in draining lymph nodes and effector CD8+ T cells in tumors. Combined T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing analysis highlighted a broader spectrum of neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells upon vaccination compared to αPD-1 monotherapy. The translational relevance of these data is supported by results obtained in the first 12 patients with metastatic deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) tumors vaccinated with an Ad vaccine encoding shared neoantigens. Expansion and diversification of TCRs were observed in post-treatment biopsies of patients with clinical response, as well as an increase in tumor-infiltrating T cells with an effector memory signature. These findings indicate a promising mechanism to overcome resistance to PD-1 blockade by promoting immunogenicity and broadening the spectrum and magnitude of neoantigen-specific T cells infiltrating tumors. © 2022 The Authors, some rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Neoantigen-based cancer vaccine therapy is a breakthrough in the field of immunotherapy. However, it is difficult for vaccines against neoantigens to overcome the immunosuppressive microenvironment, where tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a significant role. Herein, we report an iron oxide nanoparticle modified with hyaluronic acid and mannose to reshape the tumor microenvironment by targeting and repolarizing TAMs from protumor M2 to antitumor M1 phenotype. Mannose decoration could confer the nanoparticle-enhanced TAM targeting ability, while hyaluronic acid and iron oxide could repolarize M2-like macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. Combined with antigenic peptides, this nanovaccine could significantly increase the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into tumor tissue and strongly activate dendritic cells in sentinel lymph nodes. Finally, we used the dual-modified nanoparticles to first convert the tumor microenvironment and then the nanovaccine administration in a TC1 tumor model to further enhance efficacy. This strategy inhibited tumor growth and achieved a 40% cure rate in mice (two of five). In summary, this study provides a potent and rationally designed nanoadjuvant to enhance antitumor efficiency and facilitate delivery of neoantigen vaccines by repolarizing TAMs and harmonizing immune cells. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A high rate of recurrence after curative therapy is a major challenge for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Currently, no effective adjuvant therapy is available to prevent HCC recurrence. We designed a personalized neoantigen-loaded dendritic cell vaccine and neoantigen-activated T-cell therapy, and used it as adjuvant therapy to treat 10 patients with HCC who had undergone curative resection or radiofrequency ablation in the first stage of a phase II trial (NCT03067493). The primary outcomes were safety and neoantigen-specific immune response. Disease-free survival (DFS) was also evaluated. The immunotherapy was successfully administered to all the patients without unexpected delay and demonstrated a reasonable safety profile with no grade ≥3 treatment-related side effects reported. Seventy percent of patients generated de novo circulating multiclonal neoantigen-specific T-cell responses. Induced neoantigen-specific immunity was maintained over time, and epitope spreading was observed. Patients who generated immune responses to treatment exhibited prolonged DFS compared with nonresponders (P ¼ 0.012), with 71.4% experiencing no relapse for 2 years after curative treatment. High expression of an immune stimulatory signature, enhanced immune-cell infiltration (i.e., CD8þ T cells), and upregulated expression of T-cell inflammatory gene profiles were found in the primary tumors of the responders. In addition, neoantigen depletion (immunoediting) was present in the recurrent tumors compared with the primary tumors (7/9 vs. 1/17, P ¼ 0.014), suggesting that immune evasion occurred under the pressure of immunotherapy. Our study indicates that neoantigen-based combination immunotherapy is feasible, safe, and has the potential to reduce HCC recurrence after curative treatment. ©2022 American Association for Cancer Research},

Methods: A cohort of 1862 Chinese NSCLC patients who underwent targeted sequencing with a 1021-gene panel was investigated. HLA typing was done using OptiType v1.0 and neoantigens were predicted by netMHCpan v4.0. HLA LOH was inferred using the lohhla algorithm and TMB were quantified by counting the total number of non-synonymous ones based on our panel data. CIBERSORT was utilized to estimate the TME in different EGFR mutant subtype by using TCGA data. Results: HLA-A*11:01(42.59%) was the top one allele and HLA-A*33:03(12.94%) ranked 12th. EGFR L858R (22.61%) was the most prevalent gene variant. The binding affinity (IC50 MT = 22.9 nM) and shared frequency (2.93%) of EGFR L858R in combination with HLA-A*33:03 were optimal. In a subsequent further analysis on immunological features of EGFR mutant subtypes, 63.1% HLA loss of heterozygosity LOH (HLA LOH) and 0.37% (7 of 1862) B2M aberrations were found in our population, both had no significant association with EGFR mutant subtypes suggesting that the process of antigen presentation involved HLA LOH and B2M mechanisms in EGFR L858R is working. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was investigated by utilizing our panel and showed that EGFR L858R had the lowest TMB compared with other EGFR mutant subtypes. In addition, analysis of 22 immune cell types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data showed EGFR L858R was correlated with low level of CD8 T cells, activated CD4 memory T cells and elevated level of macrophage M2 suggesting an inhibited tumor microenvironment (TME). Conclusion: Our study identified that EGFR L858R neoantigen had the potential to generate cancer vaccines in NSCLC patients with HLA A*33:03. The neoantigen-based vaccines may become an effective salvage regimen for EGFR L858R subgroup after targeted therapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) failure.

	abstract = {Today, an unprecedented understanding of the cancer genome, along with major breakthroughs in oncoimmunotherapy, and a resurgence of nucleic acid vaccines against cancer are being achieved. However, in most cases, the immune system response is still insufficient to react against cancer, especially in those tumors showing low mutational burden. One way to counteract tumor escape can be the induction of bacterial translocation, a phenomenon associated with autoimmune diseases which consists of a leakage in the colonic mucosa barrier, causing the access of gut bacteria to sterile body compartments such as blood. Certain commensal or live-attenuated bacteria can be engineered in such a way as to contain nucleic acids coding for tumor neoantigens previously selected from individual tumor RNAseq data. Hypothetically, these modified bacteria, previously administered orally to a cancer patient, can be translocated by several compounds acting on colonic mucosa, thus releasing neoantigens in a systemic environment in the context of an acute inflammation. Several strategies for selecting neoantigens, suitable bacteria strains, genetic constructs, and translocation inducers to achieve tumor-specific activations of CD4 and CD8 T-cells are discussed in this hypothesis. © 2021 The Authors.

We performed immunological screening against personalized neoantigens in combination with single-cell RNA sequencing on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from bile duct and pancreatic cancer patients to characterize the transcriptomic landscape of neoantigen-reactive T cells. We found that most neoantigen-reactive CD8+ T cells displayed an exhausted state with significant CXCL13 and GZMA co-expression compared with non-neoantigen-reactive bystander cells. Most neoantigen-reactive CD4+ T cells from a patient with bile duct cancer also exhibited an exhausted phenotype but with overexpression of HOPX or ADGRG1 while lacking IL7R expression. Thus, neoantigen-reactive T cells infiltrating gastrointestinal cancers harbor distinct transcriptomic signatures, which may provide new opportunities for harnessing these cells for therapy. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {A common theme across multiple successful immunotherapies for cancer is the recognition of tumor-specific mutations (neoantigens) by T cells. The rapid discovery of such antigen responses could lead to improved therapies through the adoptive transfer of T cells engineered to express neoantigen-reactive T cell receptors (TCRs). Here, through CITE-seq (cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing) and TCR-seq of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), we develop a neoantigen-reactive T cell signature based on clonotype frequency and CD39 protein and CXCL13 mRNA expression. Screening of TCRs selected by the signature allows us to identify neoantigen-reactive TCRs with a success rate of 45% for CD8+ and 66% for CD4+ T cells. Because of the small number of samples analyzed (4 patients), generalizability remains to be tested. However, this approach can enable the quick identification of neoantigen-reactive TCRs and expedite the engineering of personalized neoantigen-reactive T cells for therapy. © 2022},

	abstract = {Major advances in cancer treatment have emerged with the introduction of immunotherapies using blocking antibodies that target T-cell inhibitory receptors, such as programmed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), known as immune checkpoints. However, most cancer patients do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies, suggesting the development of resistance mechanisms associated with either an insufficient number of preexisting tumor-specific T-cell precursors and/or inappropriate T-cell reactivation. To broaden clinical benefit, anti-PD-1/PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) neutralizing antibodies have been combined with therapeutic cancer vaccines based on non-mutant and/or mutant tumor antigens, to stimulate and expand tumor-specific T lymphocytes. Although these combination treatments achieve the expected goal in some patients, relapse linked to alterations in antigen presentation machinery (APM) of cancer cells often occurs leading to tumor escape from CD8 T-cell immunity. Remarkably, an alternative antigenic peptide repertoire, referred to as T-cell epitopes associated with impaired peptide processing (TEIPP), arises on these malignant cells with altered APM. TEIPP are derived from ubiquitous non-mutant self-proteins and represent a unique resource to target immune-edited tumors that have acquired resistance to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) related to defects in transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and possibly also to ICB. The present review discusses tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and mutant neoantigens and their use as targets in peptide- and RNA-based therapeutic cancer vaccines. Finally, this paper highlights TEIPP as a promising immunogenic non-mutant neoantigen candidates for active cancer immunotherapy and combination with TAA and mutant neoantigens. Combining these polyepitope cancer vaccines with ICB would broaden T-cell specificity and reinvigorate exhausted antitumor CTL, resulting in the eradication of all types of neoplastic cells, including immune-escaped subtypes. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Neoantigens are mutation-containing immunogenic peptides from tumor cells. Neoantigen intrinsic features are neoantigens' sequence-associated features characterized by different amino acid descriptors and physical-chemical properties, which have a crucial function in prioritization of neoantigens with immunogenic potentials and predicting patients with better survival. Different intrinsic features might have functions to varying degrees in evaluating neoantigens' potentials of immunogenicity. Identification and comparison of intrinsic features among neoantigens are particularly important for developing neoantigen-based personalized immunotherapy. However, there is still no public repository to host the intrinsic features of neoantigens. Therefore, we developed GNIFdb, a glioma neoantigen intrinsic feature database specifically designed for hosting, exploring and visualizing neoantigen and intrinsic features. The database provides a comprehensive repository of computationally predicted Human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) restricted neoantigens and their intrinsic features; a systematic annotation of neoantigens including sequence, neoantigen-associated mutation, gene expression, glioma prognosis, HLA-I subtype and binding affinity between neoantigens and HLA-I; and a genome browser to visualize them in an interactive manner. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Accurate prioritization of immunogenic neoantigens is key to developing personalized cancer vaccines and distinguishing those patients likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibition. However, there is no consensus regarding which characteristics best predict neoantigen immunogenicity, and no model to date has both high sensitivity and specificity and a significant association with survival in response to immunotherapy. We address these challenges in the prioritization of immunogenic neoantigens by (1) identifying which neoantigen characteristics best predict immunogenicity; (2) integrating these characteristics into an immunogenicity score, the NeoScore; and (3) demonstrating a significant association of the NeoScore with survival in response to immune checkpoint inhibition. One thousand random and evenly split combinations of immunogenic and nonimmunogenic neoantigens from a validated dataset were analyzed using a regularized regression model for characteristic selection. The selected characteristics, the dissociation constant and binding stability of the neoantigen:MHC class I complex and expression of the mutated gene in the tumor, were integrated into the NeoScore. A web application is provided for calculation of the NeoScore. The NeoScore results in improved, or equivalent, performance in four test datasets as measured by sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operator characteristics curve compared with previous models. Among cutaneous melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibition, a high maximum NeoScore was associated with improved survival. Overall, the NeoScore has the potential to improve neoantigen prioritization for the development of personalized vaccines and contribute to the determination of which patients are likely to respond to immunotherapy.

Multiple parameters including baseline tumor immune infiltration and on-treatment circulating tumor DNA levels were highly correlated with clinical response.

Epitope spread to non-vaccinating neoantigens, including responses to KRAS G12C and G12V mutations, were detected post-vaccination. Neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells generated post-vaccination revealed effector and cytotoxic phenotypes with increased CD4+ T cell infiltration in the post-vaccine tumor biopsy.

	abstract = {Accumulated clinical data of immune checkpoint blockades have suggested the importance of neoantigens in cancer immunity. Tumor antigens are released from dead cancer cells together with cellular components, such as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), into the tumor microenvironment. We recently reported that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a representative DAMP molecule, showed a negative impact on anti-tumor immunity. However, a positive role of HMGB1 in the initiation of innate and subsequent adaptive immunity has also been demonstrated; thus, the effects of HMGB1 on anti-tumor immunity have not been well understood. In this study, we identified nine immunogenic neoantigen epitopes of B16F10 murine melanoma cells and subsequently investigated the effects of suppression of HMGB1 on the induction of neoantigen-specific immunity using HMGB1-knockout tumors. Neoantigen-reactive T cells were expanded in B16F10 tumor-bearing mice, and T cell receptor repertoire analysis suggested that neoantigen-reactive T cells were oligo-clonally increased in B16F10 tumor bearers. An increase of neoantigen-reactive T cells and oligoclonal expansion of the T cells were similarly detected in HMGB1-knockout tumor-bearing mice. The induction of neoantigen-specific immunity under the suppression of HMGB1 in the tumor microenvironment shown in this study supports further development of combination therapy of HMGB1 suppression with neoantigen-targeted cancer immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint blockade therapy. © 2022 The Authors.

Unlike intradermal injection of simple mixed components with short-term immune protection, the neoantigen immunotherapeutic-gels evoke long-term immune protection to achieve significant prophylactic and therapeutic activity against HCC through only one-shot administration without any side effects. Notably, the synergized immunotherapy by further combining NGC-gels with TIM-3 antibody significantly reduces regulatory T-cells and increases the IFN-γ and IL-12p70 levels in tumor tissues for promoting the infiltration of IFN-γ+CD8+T-cells and 41BB+CD8+T-cells to achieve complete remission (4/7) and prevent pulmonary metastasis in orthotopic HCC, and establish long-term memory against tumor rechallenge with remarkably longer survival time (180 days).

However, targeting antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and inducing robust neoantigen-specific cellular immunity remain challenges. Here, a safe and broad-spectrum neoantigen vaccine delivery system is proposed (GP-Neoantigen) based on β-1,3-glucan particles (GPs) derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and coupling peptide antigens with GPs through convenient click chemistry. The prepared system has a highly uniform particle size and high APC targeting specificity. In mice, the vaccine system induced a robust specific CD8+ T cell immune response and humoral immune response against various conjugated peptide antigens and showed strong tumor growth inhibitory activity in EG7·OVA lymphoma, B16F10 melanoma, 4T1 breast cancer, and CT26 colon cancer models. The combination of the toll-like receptors (TLRs) agonist PolyI:C and CpG 2395 further enhanced the antitumor response of the particle system, achieving complete tumor clearance in multiple mouse models and inducing long-term rejection of reinoculated tumors. These results provide the broad possibility for its further clinical promotion and personalized vaccine treatment. © 2022 The Authors. Advanced Science published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

	abstract = {(1) Background: Mutation-specific T cell receptor (TCR)-based adoptive T cell therapy repre-sents a truly tumor-specific immunotherapeutic strategy. However, isolating neoepitope-specific TCRs remains a challenge. (2) Methods: We investigated, side by side, different TCR repertoires—patients’ peripheral lymphocytes (PBLs) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), PBLs of healthy donors, and a humanized mouse model—to isolate neoepitope-specific TCRs against eight neoepitope candidates from a colon cancer and an ovarian cancer patient. Neoepitope candidates were used to stimulate T cells from different repertoires in vitro to generate neoepitope-specific T cells and isolate the specific TCRs. (3) Results: We isolated six TCRs from healthy donors, directed against four neoepitope candidates and one TCR from the murine T cell repertoire. Endogenous processing of one neoepitope, for which we isolated one TCR from both human and mouse-derived repertoires, could be shown. No neoepitope-specific TCR could be generated from the patients’ own repertoire. (4) Conclusion: Our data indicate that successful isolation of neoepitope-specific TCRs depends on various factors such as the heathy donor’s TCR repertoire or the presence of a tumor microenvi-ronment allowing neoepitope-specific immune responses of the host. We show the advantage and feasibility of using healthy donor repertoires and humanized mouse TCR repertoires to generate mutation-specific TCRs with different specificities, especially in a setting when the availability of patient material is limited. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Alternatives to conventional cancer treatments are highly sought after for high-risk malignancies that have a poor response to established treatment modalities. With research advancing rapidly in the past decade, neoantigen-based immunotherapeutic approaches represent an effective and highly tolerable therapeutic option. Neoantigens are tumor-specific antigens that are not expressed in normal cells and possess significant immunogenic potential. Several recent studies have described the conceptual framework and methodologies to generate neoantigen-based vaccines as well as the formulation of appropriate clinical trials to advance this approach for patient care. This review aims to describe some of the key studies in the recent literature in this rapidly evolving field and summarize the current advances in neoantigen identification and selection, vaccine generation and delivery, and the optimization of neoantigen-based therapeutic strategies, including the early data from pivotal clinical studies. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Aims: This trial explored the safety and efficacy of neoantigen-specific T cells (Nas-Ts) combined with anti-PD-1 (Nas-T + anti-PD-1). Patients & methods: This non-randomized trial recruited participants with solid tumors treated with at least two prior systemic treatment lines. For comparison, 1:1-matched controls who received anti-PD-1 alone were recruited. The primary end point was safety. Results: 15 participants were enrolled in the Nas-T + anti-PD-1 group, the objective response rate was 33.3%, and the disease control rate was 93.3%. The median progression-free survival was significantly different between the Nas-T + anti-PD-1 and control groups (13.8 vs 4.2 months; p = 0.024), but no difference in overall survival was found (p = 0.126). The most common adverse events were maculopapular skin reaction (53.3%), rash (53.3%), hepatotoxicity (53.3%) and fever (53.3%) in the Nas-T + anti-PD-1 group. No serious safety issues were experienced. Conclusion: Nas-Ts combined with anti-PD-1 could be more effective than anti-PD-1 alone in prolonging progression-free survival, with good safety. Plain language summary Cancer immune escape is a major mechanism allowing cancer cells to avoid treatments, and PD-1 is one of those mechanisms. Nevertheless, therapies targeting PD-1 are still somewhat unsatisfactory. In this trial, we explored the safety and efficacy of mutant neoantigen-specific T cells (Nas-Ts) as adoptive cell immunotherapy individualized for each tumor, combined with an anti-PD-1 regimen (Nas-T + anti-PD-1). We recruited participants with solid tumors treated with at least two prior systemic treatment lines: 15 participants were enrolled in the Nas-T + anti-PD-1 group and 15 more in the control group. After the last follow-up, the percentage of patients on whom a therapy had some defined effect as well as the percentage of patients with advanced and metastatic cancer who achieved complete response was significantly higher for those who received Nas-T + anti-PD-1. No serious safety issues were experienced. This study confirmed that Nas-Ts combined with anti-PD-1 could be more effective than anti-PD-1 alone in delaying progression, with good safety.  © 2022 Future Medicine Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Neoantigens are considered ideal targets for immunotherapy, especially tumor vaccine, because of their strong specificity and immunogenicity. Here, we developed a neoantigen nanovaccine used liposomes with lymph-node targeting characteristic. Methods: Our nanovaccine was composed of neoantigens, an amphiphilic liposome and an adjuvant Montanide™ ISA 51. Small animal imaging system and immunofluorescence staining were used to identify the distribution of nanovaccines. A subcutaneous-tumor-resection mouse model of melanoma was established to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy. Flow cytometry was performed to assay the immune responses initiated by nanovaccines. Results: Nanovaccines could traffic to lymph nodes, be uptaken by CD11c+ DCs and promote DCs maturity. After the treatment of our neoantigen nanovaccines, the average recurrence time was extended from 11 to 16 days and the median survival time was even prolonged 7.5 days relative to the control group (NS group). Nanovaccines increased neoantigen-specific T cells to 10-fold of free vaccines, and upregulated Th1 cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α. The anti-tumor activity of spleen lymphocytes in the nanovaccine group was significantly stronger than that of other groups. However, some immune-inhibitory cells or molecules in tumor microenvironment have been detected upregulated under the immune pressure of neoantigen nanovaccines, such as Tregs and PD-L1. The efficacy of the neoantigen nanovaccine combined with anti-PD1 antibody or Treg inhibiting peptide P60 was better than that of the single treatment. Conclusions: We developed a general vaccine strategy, triggering specific T cell responses, and provided feasible combination strategies for better anti-tumor efficacy.

	abstract = {Post-translational modifications can lead to a break in immune tolerance in autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). Deamidation, the conversion of glutamine to glutamic acid by transglutaminase (TGM) enzymes, is a post-translational modification of interest, with deamidated peptides being reported as autoantigens in T1D. However, little is known about how Tgm2, the most ubiquitously expressed Tgm isoform, is regulated and how tolerance against deamidated peptides is lost. Here, we report on the aberrant expression and regulation of Tgm2 in the pancreas and thymus of NOD mice. We demonstrate that Tgm2 expression is induced by the inflammatory cytokines IL1β and IFNγ in a synergistic manner and that murine pancreatic islets of NOD mice have higher Tgm2 levels, while Tgm2 levels in medullary thymic epithelial cells are reduced. We thus provide the first direct evidence to our knowledge that central tolerance establishment against deamidated peptides might be impaired due to lower Tgm2 expression in NOD medullary thymic epithelial cells, which together with the aberrantly high levels of deamidated peptides in NOD β-cells underscores the role of deamidation in amplifying T-cell reactivity.

	abstract = {Neoantigens derived from somatic mutations are specific to cancer cells and are ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy. KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene and drives the pathogenesis of several cancers. Here we show the identification and development of an affinity-enhanced T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes a peptide derived from the most common KRAS mutant, KRASG12D, presented in the context of HLA-A*11:01. The affinity of the engineered TCR is increased by over one million-fold yet fully able to distinguish KRASG12D over KRASWT. While crystal structures reveal few discernible differences in TCR interactions with KRASWT versus KRASG12D, thermodynamic analysis and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that TCR specificity is driven by differences in indirect electrostatic interactions. The affinity enhanced TCR, fused to a humanized anti-CD3 scFv, enables selective killing of cancer cells expressing KRASG12D. Our work thus reveals a molecular mechanism that drives TCR selectivity and describes a soluble bispecific molecule with therapeutic potential against cancers harboring a common shared neoantigen. © 2022, The Author(s).},

BDVs-Neo and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were inoculated subcutaneously within hydrogel (Gel), whereas sustaining release of BDVs-Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and GM-CSF recruited the dendritic cells (DCs). Virtually, Gel-BDVs-Neo combined with the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody intensively enhanced proliferation and activation of tumour-infiltrated T cells, as well as memory T cell clone expansion. Consequently, BDVs-Neo combining with checkpoint blockade therapy effectively prevented tumour relapse and metastasis. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Neoantigens are widely reported to induce T-cell response and lead to tumor regression, indicating a promising potential to immunotherapy. Previously, we constructed an open-access database, i.e., dbPepNeo, providing a systematic resource for human tumor neoantigens to storage and query. In order to expand data volume and application scope, we updated dbPepNeo to version 2.0 (http://www.biostatistics.online/dbPepNeo2). Here, we provide about 801 high-confidence (HC) neoantigens (increased by 170%) and 842,289 low-confidence (LC) HLA immunopeptidomes (increased by 107%). Notably, 55 class II HC neoantigens and 630 neoantigen-reactive T-cell receptor-β (TCRβ) sequences were firstly included. Besides, two new analytical tools are developed, DeepCNN-Ineo and BLASTdb. DeepCNN-Ineo predicts the immunogenicity of class I neoantigens, and BLASTdb performs local alignments to look for sequence similarities in dbPepNeo2.0. Meanwhile, the web features and interface have been greatly improved and enhanced. Copyright © 2022 Lu, Xu, Jian, Tan, Zhao, Liu, Zhang, Liu, Chen, Lin and Xie.},

	abstract = {Elimination of cancerous cells by the immune system is an important mechanism of protection from cancer, however, its effectiveness can be reduced owing to development of resistance and evasion. To understand the systemic immune response in advanced untreated primary colorectal cancer, we analyze immune subtypes and immune evasion via neoantigen-related mechanisms. We identify a distinctive cancer subtype characterized by immune evasion and very poor overall survival. This subtype has less clonal highly expressed neoantigens and high chromosomal instability, resulting in adaptive immune resistance mediated by the immune checkpoint molecules and neoantigen presentation disorders. We also observe that neoantigen depletion caused by immunoediting and high clonal neoantigen load are correlated with a good overall survival. Our results indicate that the status of the tumor microenvironment and neoantigen composition are promising new prognostic biomarkers with potential relevance for treatment plan decisions in advanced CRC. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Neoantigens are the key targets of antitumor immune responses from cytotoxic T cells and play a critical role in affecting tumor progressions and immunotherapy treatment responses. However, little is known about how the interaction between neoantigens and T cells ultimately affects the evolution of cancerous masses. Here, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model, named neoantigen–T cell interaction estimation (netie) to infer the history of neoantigen-CD8+ T cell interactions in tumors. Netie was systematically validated and applied to examine the molecular patterns of 3,219 tumors, compiled from a panel of 18 cancer types. We showed that tumors with an increase in immune selection pressure over time are associated with T cells that have an activation-related expression signature. We also identified a subset of exhausted cytotoxic T cells postimmunotherapy associated with tumor clones that newly arise after treatment. These analyses demonstrate how netie enables the interrogation of the relationship between individual neoantigen repertoires and the tumor molecular profiles. We found that a T cell inflammation gene expression profile (TIGEP) is more predictive of patient outcomes in the tumors with an increase in immune pressure over time, which reveals a curious synergy between T cells and neoantigen distributions. Overall, we provide a new tool that is capable of revealing the imprints left by neoantigens during each tumor’s developmental process and of predicting how tumors will progress under further pressure of the host’s immune system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) often responds to PD-1 pathway blockade, regardless of tumor-viral status (∼80% of cases driven by the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV)). Prior studies have characterized tumor-specific T cell responses to MCPyV, which have typically been CD8, but little is known about the T cell response to UV-induced neoantigens. Methods: A patient in her mid-50s with virus-negative (VN) MCC developed large liver metastases after a brief initial response to chemotherapy. She received anti-PD-L1 (avelumab) and had a partial response within 4 weeks. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed to determine potential neoantigen peptides. Characterization of peripheral blood neoantigen T cell responses was evaluated via interferon-gamma (IFNγ) ELISpot, flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. Tumor-resident T cells were characterized by multiplexed immunohistochemistry. Results: WES identified 1027 tumor-specific somatic mutations, similar to the published average of 1121 for VN-MCCs. Peptide prediction with a binding cut-off of ≤100 nM resulted in 77 peptides that were synthesized for T cell assays. Although peptides were predicted based on class I HLAs, we identified circulating CD4 T cells targeting 5 of 77 neoantigens. In contrast, no neoantigen-specific CD8 T cell responses were detected. Neoantigen-specific CD4 T cells were undetectable in blood before anti-PD-L1 therapy but became readily detectible shortly after starting therapy. T cells produced robust IFNγwhen stimulated by neoantigen (mutant) peptides but not by the normal (wild-type) peptides. Single cell RNAseq showed neoantigen-reactive T cells expressed the Th1-associated transcription factor (T-bet) and associated cytokines. These CD4 T cells did not significantly exhibit cytotoxicity or non-Th1 markers. Within the pretreatment tumor, resident CD4 T cells were also Th1-skewed and expressed T-bet. Conclusions: We identified and characterized tumor-specific Th1-skewed CD4 T cells targeting multiple neoantigens in a patient who experienced a profound and durable partial response to anti-PD-L1 therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of neoantigen-specific T cell responses in MCC. Although CD4 and CD8 T cells recognizing viral tumor antigens are often detectible in virus-positive MCC, only CD4 T cells recognizing neoantigens were detected in this patient. These findings suggest that CD4 T cells can play an important role in the response to anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. © 2022 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).},

	abstract = {Introduction Neoantigens derived from tumour somatic mutations are recognised as ideal vaccine targets. Tumour neoantigens have been studied in a wide range of tumours. Most of research on neoantigens has focused just on a unique tumour and a single mutated gene. Currently, a few studies have reported using a mixture of neoantigen peptides derived from multiple genetic mutation sites in the treatment of genomic unstable advanced solid malignancies. The trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of individualised tumour neoantigen peptide mixtures in the treatment of genomic unstable advanced solid malignant tumours. Methods and analysis This is a prospective, non-randomised, open, single-centre, single-arm, phase I trial. Patients with genomic unstable advanced solid malignancies are eligible for study participations. 20 patients will be included in the trial. Through the whole exome and transcriptome sequencing analysis of the fresh blood and tumour tissues of the enrolled patients, the 20 25-33aa antigen peptides with the highest mutation scores of the patients will be screened out, and the corresponding new antigen peptides will be synthesised and prepared. Patients will be treated with their own individualised neoantigen polypeptide combined with a polypeptide adjuvant (human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). The primary endpoint is safety indicators, including general and specific adverse events which will be monitored continuously. Secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, objective response rate, objective duration of remission, 1-year survival rate and overall survival. Ethics and dissemination This study has received approval from the Ethics Committee of Chongqing University Cancer Hospital on 21 November 2019 (207/2019). The findings of this trial will be disseminated through national and international presentations and peer-reviewed publications.

	abstract = {Some of the mutant peptides produced by gene mutation transcription and translation have the ability to induce specific T cells, which are called new antigens. Neoantigen-based peptide, DNA, RNA, and dendritic cell vaccines have been used in the clinic. In this paper, we describe a lung metastasis of a phyllodes tumor patient demonstrating pathological complete response following treatment containing personalized multi-epitope peptide neoantigen nano-vaccine. Based on whole-exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing, and new antigen prediction, several mutated peptide fragments were predicted to bind to the patient’s human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allotypes, including ten peptides with high predicted binding affinity for six genes. The pulmonary metastases remained stable after the four cycles of anti-PD1 and anlotinib. After the addition of the multi-epitope peptide neoantigen nano-vaccine, the tumor began to collapse and contracture developed, accompanied by a decrease of tumor markers to normal, and complete pathological remission was achieved. With the use of the vaccination, recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) was used every time, and low-dose cyclophosphamide was injected every 3 weeks to improve efficacy. Peripheral blood immune monitoring demonstrated immune reactivity against a series of peptides, with the most robust post-vaccine T-cell response detected against the HLA-DRB1*0901-restricted SLC44A5 V54F peptide.

	abstract = {Neoantigens are ideal targets for dendritic cell (DC) vaccines. So far, only a few neoantigen-based DC vaccines have been investigated in clinical trials. Here, we reported a case of a patient with metastatic gastric cancer who received personalized neoantigen-loaded monocyte-derived dendritic cell (Neo-MoDC) vaccines followed by combination therapy of the Neo-MoDC and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). The patient developed T cell responses against neoantigens after receiving the Neo-MoDC vaccine alone. The following combination therapy triggered a stronger immune response and mediated complete regression of all tumors for over 25 months till October, 2021. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells recognized seven of the eight vaccine neoantigens. And the frequency of neoantigen-specific T cell clones increased obviously after vaccination. Overall, this report describing a complete tumor regression in a gastric cancer patient mediated by Neo-MoDC vaccine in combination with ICI, and suggesting a promising treatment for patients with metastatic gastric cancer. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of tumor hierarchy and genetic instability can be explained by the “two-hits theory” and results in the occurrence of many somatic mutations. The expression of nonsynonymous mutations results in the production of mutant proteins from tumor cells, namely tumor-specific antigens called neoantigens. Because neoantigens do not exist in healthy cells, they have the potential to stimulate antitumor immune responses by CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation without jeopardizing normal tissues. Immunotherapy has reshaped the cancer treatment paradigm in recent decades with the introduction of immune-checkpoint blockade therapy and transgenic T-cell receptor/chimeric antigen receptor T cells. However, these strategies performed poorly in solid tumors because of the obstacles of the immunosuppressive microenvironment caused by regulatory T cells and other suppressor cells. Therefore, other immunotherapeutic strategies are under development, such as personalized vaccines, to trigger de novo T-cell responses against neoantigens and lead to the amplification of tumor-specific T-cell subclones. Neoantigen epitope prediction algorithms have enabled the detection of neoantigens and the creation of tailored neoantigen vaccines as a result of the fast development of next-generation sequencing and cancer bioinformatics. Here we provide an overview of the current neoantigen cancer vaccines and adoptive T-cell transfer therapy with neoantigen-specific lymphocytes. We also discuss the challenges in developing neoantigen-targeted immunotherapeutic strategies for cancer. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Abstract: Autogene cevumeran is an individualized neoantigen-specific therapy (iNeST) under development for the treatment of various solid tumors. It consists of an RNA-Lipoplex (RNA-LPX) in which the encapsulated mRNA molecule encodes up to ten neoepitopes identified from each individual patient. In association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and MHC class II, these neoantigens can potentially stimulate and expand neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, leading to antitumor responses. As part of the pharmacokinetic (PK) property assessment of Autogene cevumeran in patients, both the lipid and mRNA content in circulation are measured. This work focused on our efforts to establish a sensitive and robust method for the measurement of mRNA levels of RNA-LPX in plasma. Due to the chemical characteristics of mRNA, extra precautions are required in order to effectively preserve mRNA integrity in human plasma during sample collection, handling and storage. To this end, a number of sample collection tubes and storage conditions were evaluated in order to inform the most optimal and operationally feasible conditions by which to preserve mRNA integrity during sample collection and upon freeze–thaw. PAXgene Blood ccfDNA tubes successfully prevented mRNA degradation and were subsequently selected for patient sample collection in the clinical trial. A branched DNA (bDNA)-based mRNA PK assay was developed to achieve the desired assay performance. Here, we discuss the evaluation of various sample collection and processing conditions as well as the optimization of the work flow during bDNA PK method development.

	abstract = {Adoptive cell therapy with tumor-specific T cells can mediate durable cancer regression. The prime target of tumor-specific T cells are neoantigens arising from mutations in self-proteins during malignant transformation. To understand T cell recognition of cancer neoantigens at the atomic level, we studied oligoclonal T cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize a neoepitope arising from a driver mutation in the p53 oncogene (p53R175H) presented by the major histocompatibility complex class I molecule HLA-A2. We previously reported the structures of three p53R175H-specific TCRs (38-10, 12-6, and 1a2) bound to p53R175H and HLA-A2. The structures showed that these TCRs discriminate between WT and mutant p53 by forming extensive interactions with the R175H mutation. Here, we report the structure of a fourth p53R175H-specific TCR (6-11) in complex with p53R175H and HLA-A2. In contrast to 38-10, 12-6, and 1a2, TCR 6-11 makes no direct contacts with the R175H mutation, yet is still able to distinguish mutant from WT p53. Structure-based in silico mutagenesis revealed that the 60-fold loss in 6-11 binding affinity for WT p53 compared to p53R175H is mainly due to the higher energetic cost of desolvating R175 in the WT p53 peptide during complex formation than H175 in the mutant. This indirect strategy for preferential neoantigen recognition by 6-11 is fundamentally different from the direct strategies employed by other TCRs and highlights the multiplicity of solutions to recognizing p53R175H with sufficient selectivity to mediate T cell killing of tumor but not normal cells. © 2022 THE AUTHORS.},

We recently conducted a clinical study that combined neoantigen nanovaccine with anti-PD-1 antibody. Here, we reported a case with a clear beneficial outcome from this treatment. We established a process that includes comprehensive identification of individual mutations, computational prediction of new epitopes, and design and manufacture of unique nanovaccines for this patient. Nanovaccine started after a relapse in third-line treatment. We assessed the patient’s clinical outcome and circulating immune response. In this advanced pancreatic cancer patient, the OS associated with the vaccine treatment was 10.5 months. A peptide-specific T-cell response against 9 of the 12 vaccine peptides could be detected sequentially. Robust neoantigen-specific T cell responses were also detected by IFN-γ ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining. In conclusion, sustained functional neoantigen-specific T cell therapy combined with immune checkpoint targeting may be well suited to help control progressive metastatic pancreatic cancer.

	abstract = {For the past decade, adoptive cell therapy including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, genetically modified cytotoxic lymphocytes expressing a chimeric antigen receptor, or a novel T-cell receptor has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers. Progress within exome sequencing and neoantigen prediction technologies provides opportunities for further development of personalized immunotherapies. In this study, we present a novel strategy to deliver in silico predicted neoantigens to autologous dendritic cells (DCs) using paramagnetic beads (EpiTCer beads). DCs pulsed with EpiTCer beads are superior in enriching for healthy donor and patient blood-derived tumor-specific CD8+ T cells compared to DC loaded with whole-tumor lysate or 9mer neoantigen peptides. A dose-dependent effect was observed, with higher EpiTCer bead per DC being favorable. We concluded that CD8+ T cells enriched by DC loaded with EpiTCer beads are tumor specific with limited tumor cross-reactivity and low recognition of autologous non-activated monocytes or CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, tumor specificity and recognition were improved and preserved after additional expansion using our Good Manufacturing Process (GMP)-compatible rapid expansion protocol. Phenotypic analysis of patient-derived EpiTCer DC expanded CD8+ T cells revealed efficient maturation, with high frequencies of central memory and effector memory T cells, similar to those observed in autologous expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. These results indicate that DC pulsed with EpiTCer beads enrich for a T-cell population with high capacity of tumor recognition and elimination, which are features needed for a T-cell product to be used for personalized adoptive cell therapy.

	abstract = {Background: Adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) fails to consistently elicit tumor rejection. Manipulation of intrinsic factors that inhibit T cell effector function and neoantigen recognition may therefore improve TIL therapy outcomes. We previously identified the cytokine-induced SH2 protein (CISH) as a key regulator of T cell functional avidity in mice. Here, we investigate the mechanistic role of CISH in regulating human T cell effector function in solid tumors and demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 disruption of CISH enhances TIL neoantigen recognition and response to checkpoint blockade. Methods: Single-cell gene expression profiling was used to identify a negative correlation between high CISH expression and TIL activation in patient-derived TIL. A GMP-compliant CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing process was developed to assess the impact of CISH disruption on the molecular and functional phenotype of human peripheral blood T cells and TIL. Tumor-specific T cells with disrupted Cish function were adoptively transferred into tumor-bearing mice and evaluated for efficacy with or without checkpoint blockade. Findings: CISH expression was associated with T cell dysfunction. CISH deletion using CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in hyper-activation and improved functional avidity against tumor-derived neoantigens without perturbing T cell maturation. Cish knockout resulted in increased susceptibility to checkpoint blockade in vivo. Conclusions: CISH negatively regulates human T cell effector function, and its genetic disruption offers a novel avenue to improve the therapeutic efficacy of adoptive TIL therapy.

Here we explored, in two cancer murine models, different therapeutic combinations of ICI with personalized DNA vaccines expressing neoantigens and delivered by electroporation (EP). Anti-cancer efficacy was evaluated using vaccines with or without CD4 epitopes. Therapeutic DNA vaccines showed synergistic effects in different therapeutic protocols including established large tumors. Flow cytometry (FC) was utilized to measure CD8, CD4, Treg, and switched B cells as well as neoantigen-specific immune responses, which were also measured by IFN-γ ELIspot. Immune responses were augmented in combination with αCTLA4 but not with αPD1 in the MC38 tumor-bearing mice, significantly impacting tumor growth. Similarly, neoantigen-specific T cell immune responses were enhanced in combined treatment with αCTLA-4 in the CT26 tumor model where large tumors regressed in all mice, while monotherapy with αCTLA-4 was less efficacious. In line with previous evidence, we observed an increased switched B cells in the spleen of mice treated with αCTLA-4 alone or in combination with NCV. These results support the use of NCV delivered by DNA-EP with αCTLA-4 and suggest a new combined therapy for clinical testing. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: The safety and immunogenicity of a personalized neoantigen-based peptide vaccine, iNeo-Vac-P01, was reported previously in patients with a variety of cancer types. The current study investigated the synergistic effects of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and neoantigen vaccination in cancer patients and tumor-bearing mice. Methods: Twenty-eight cancer patients were enrolled in this study, including 10 patients who had received RFA treatment within 6 months before vaccination (Cohort 1), and 18 patients who had not (Cohort 2). Individualized neoantigen peptide vaccines were designed, manufactured, and subcutaneously administrated with GM-CSF as an adjuvant for all patients. Mouse models were employed to validate the synergistic efficacy of combination treatment of RFA and neoantigen vaccination. Results: Longer median progression free survival (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS) were observed in patients in Cohort 1 compared to patients in Cohort 2 (4.42 and 20.18 months vs. 2.82 and 10.94 months). The results of ex vivo IFN-γ ELISpot assay showed that patients in Cohort 1 had stronger neoantigen-specific immune responses at baseline and post vaccination. Mice receiving combination treatment of RFA and neoantigen vaccines displayed higher antitumor immune responses than mice receiving single modality. The combination of PD-1 blockage with RFA and neoantigen vaccines further enhanced the antitumor response in mice. Conclusion: Neoantigen vaccination after local RFA treatment could improve the clinical and immune response among patients of different cancer types. The synergistic antitumor potentials of these two modalities were also validated in mice, and might be further enhanced by immune checkpoint inhibition. The mechanisms of their synergies require further investigation. Clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier NCT03662815.

	abstract = {Background Cancer-associated neoantigens (neoAg) derived from tumor genomic sequencing and predictive algorithms for mutated peptides are a promising basis for therapeutic vaccines under investigation. Although these are generally designed to bind major histocompatibility complex class I and induce CD8 cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity, results from preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that the majority of neoAg vaccines efficiently induce CD4 T helper (Th) responses but not CTL. Despite this, these vaccines have demonstrated clinical efficacy. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of CD4 + T cell-mediated tumor protection is critical to optimizing this immunotherapeutic strategy. Methods We investigated this phenomenon in the mineral oil-induced plasmacytoma (MOPC).315.BM (MOPC315) mouse model of multiple myeloma, a malignancy of plasma cells. MOPC315 cells express in their lambda chain a unique tumor-specific neoAg, an idiotypic (Id) peptide. We generated a vaccine formulated with this Id peptide fused to a heat shock protein HSC70 binding (HSB) motif co-delivered with poly (I:C). The immunogenicity of the Id-vaccine was measured in splenocytes by ELISpot. Mice were challenged with MOPC315 cells and antitumor immunity was assessed by co-incubating splenocytes and bone marrow mononuclear cells derived from vaccinated mice and controls, with the Id antigen and irradiated MOPC315 cells. The frequency of activated CD4 and CD8 T cells and their phenotype were characterized by flow cytometry. Results Id-vaccine efficiently induced antigen-specific CD4 Th activity and antitumor immunity, protecting mice from MOPC315 tumor growth. CD4 cytolytic activity was not detected under these conditions. Polyfunctional CD8 T cells homed to the bone marrow microenvironment of protected mice and preferentially expanded only when restimulated ex vivo with both Id peptide and MOPC315 cells. Protective activity was abrogated by depletion of either CD4 or CD8 lymphocytes. Conclusion These results demonstrate that Id-HSB +poly (I:C) vaccine protects against MOPC315 growth by priming Id-specific CD4 Th cells that confer protection against tumor but are not directly cytotoxic. These data indicate that activation of CD8 CTL against MOPC315-associated antigens not present in the vaccine is one of the major mechanisms of tumor immunity.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

	abstract = {The good clinical results of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in recent cancer therapy and the success of RNA vaccines against SARS-nCoV2 have provided important lessons to the scientific community. On the one hand, the efficacy of ICI depends on the number and immunogenicity of tumor neoantigens (TNAs) which unfortunately are not abundantly expressed in many cancer subtypes. On the other hand, novel RNA vaccines have significantly improved both the stability and immunogenicity of mRNA and its efficient delivery, this way overcoming past technique limitations and also allowing a quick vaccine development at the same time. These two facts together have triggered a resurgence of therapeutic cancer vaccines which can be designed to include individual TNAs and be synthesized in a timeframe short enough to be suitable for the tailored treatment of a given cancer patient. In this chapter, we explain the pipeline for the synthesis of TNA-carrying RNA vaccines which encompasses several steps such as individual tumor next-generation sequencing (NGS), selection of immunogenic TNAs, nucleic acid synthesis, drug delivery systems, and immunogenicity assessment, all of each step comprising different alternatives and variations which will be discussed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Personalized neoantigen vaccines are a highly specific cancer treatment designed to induce a robust cytotoxic T-cell attack against a patient’s cancer antigens. In this study, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov for neoantigen vaccine clinical trials and systematically analyzed them, a total of 147 trials. Peptide vaccines are the largest neoantigen vaccine type, comprising up to 41% of the clinical trials. However, mRNA vaccines are a growing neoantigen vaccine group, especially in the most recent clinical trials. The most common cancer types in the clinical trials are glioma, lung cancer, and malignant melanoma, being seen in more than half of the clinical trials. Small-cell lung cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer are the largest individual cancer types. According to the results from the clinical trials, neoantigen vaccines work best when combined with other cancer treatments, and popular combination treatments include immune checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Additionally, half of the clinical trials combined neoantigen vaccines with an adjuvant to boost the immune effects, with poly-ICLC being the most recurrent adjuvant choice.

	abstract = {Neoantigens derived from non-synonymous somatic mutations are restricted to malignant cells and are thus considered ideal targets for T cell receptor (TCR)-based immunotherapy. Adoptive transfer of T cells bearing neoantigen-specific TCRs exhibits the ability to preferentially target tumor cells while remaining harmless to normal cells. High-avidity TCRs specific for neoantigens expressed on AML cells have been identified in vitro and verified using xenograft mouse models. Preclinical studies of these neoantigen-specific TCR-T cells are underway and offer great promise as safe and effective therapies. Additionally, TCR-based immunotherapies targeting tumor-associated antigens are used in early-phase clinical trials for the treatment of AML and show encouraging anti-leukemic effects. These clinical experiences support the application of TCR-T cells that are specifically designed to recognize neoantigens. In this review, we will provide a detailed profile of verified neoantigens in AML, describe the strategies to identify neoantigen-specific TCRs, and discuss the potential of neoantigen-specific T-cell-based immunotherapy in AML. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignancy involving human brain, with a poor prognosis. Although various advanced treatment strategies have been incorporated into clinical practice, especially surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the median patient survival is approximately 14 months. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have been used successfully in hematological cancers. However, CAR-T cell therapy of solid malignancies, especially GBM, is a challenge. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), although effective in some solid tumors, are of limited use in patients with GBM. Neoantigens, which are derived from somatic mutations and expressed only on tumor cells, have led to a new approach in cancer immunotherapy. Personalized vaccine and adoptive cell therapies (ACT), the two main treatment methods targeting neoantigen, are efficacious in various cancers. Two clinical trials of personalized vaccine in GBM demonstrated immunogenicity and safety. We reviewed the development of neoantigens mainly in the field of GBM and possible therapeutic applications and challenges. In addition, organoids, which preserve the heterogeneity and molecular signatures of GBM, may play a vital role in the study of neoantigens in GBM. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are used in cancer immunotherapy to block programmed death-1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, but the response rate for ICIs is still low and tumor cell heterogeneity is considered to be responsible for resistance to immunotherapy. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have an essential role in the anti-tumor effect of cancer immunotherapy; however, the specificity of TILs in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is elusive. In this study, we analyzed a 58-year-old case with clear cell RCC (ccRCC) with the tumor showing macroscopic and microscopic heterogeneity. The tumor was composed of low-grade and high-grade ccRCC. A tumor cell line (1226 RCC cells) and TILs were isolated from the high-grade ccRCC lesion, and a TIL clone recognized a novel neoantigen peptide (YVVPGSPCL) encoded by a missense mutation of the tensin 1 (TNS1) gene in a human leukocyte antigen-C*03:03-restricted fashion. The TNS1 gene mutation was not detected in the low-grade ccRCC lesion and the TIL clone did not recognized low-grade ccRCC cells. The missense mutation of TNS1 encoding the S1309Y mutation was found to be related to cell migration by gene over-expression. These findings suggest that macroscopically and microscopically heterogenous tumors might show heterogenous gene mutations and reactivity to TILs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The majority of neoantigens arise from unique mutations that are not shared between individual patients, making neoantigen-directed immunotherapy a fully personalized treatment approach. Novel technical advances in next-generation sequencing of tumor samples and artificial intelligence (AI) allow fast and systematic prediction of tumor neoantigens. This study investigates feasibility, safety, immunity, and anti-tumor potential of the personalized peptide-based neoantigen vaccine, EVX-01, including the novel CD8+ T-cell inducing adjuvant, CAF®09b, in patients with metastatic melanoma (NTC03715985). The AI platform PIONEERTM was used for identification of tumor-derived neoantigens to be included in a peptide-based personalized therapeutic cancer vaccine. EVX-01 immunotherapy consisted of 6 administrations with 5–10 PIONEERTM-predicted neoantigens as synthetic peptides combined with the novel liposome-based Cationic Adjuvant Formulation 09b (CAF®09b) to strengthen T-cell responses. EVX-01 was combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors to augment the activity of EVX-01-induced immune responses. The primary endpoint was safety, exploratory endpoints included feasibility, immunologic and objective responses. This interim analysis reports the results from the first dose-level cohort of five patients. We documented a short vaccine manufacturing time of 48–55 days which enabled the initiation of EVX-01 treatment within 60 days from baseline biopsy. No severe adverse events were observed. EVX-01 elicited long-lasting EVX-01-specific T-cell responses in all patients. Competitive manufacturing time was demonstrated. EVX-01 was shown to be safe and able to elicit immune responses targeting tumor neoantigens with encouraging early indications of a clinical and meaningful antitumor efficacy, warranting further study. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {A proteogenomics-based neoantigen prediction pipeline, namely ProGeo-neo, was pre-viously developed by our team to predict neoantigens, allowing the identification of class-I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding peptides based on single-nucleotide variation (SNV) mutations. To improve it, we here present an updated pipeline, i.e., ProGeo-neo v2.0, in which a one-stop software solution was proposed to identify neoantigens based on the paired tumor-normal whole genome sequencing (WGS)/whole exome sequencing (WES) data in FASTQ format. Preferably, in ProGeo-neo v2.0, several new features are provided. In addition to the identification of MHC-I neoantigens, the new version supports the prediction of MHC class II-restricted neoantigens, i.e., peptides up to 30-mer in length. Moreover, the source of neoantigens has been expanded, allowing more candidate neoantigens to be identified, such as in-frame insertion-deletion (indels) mutations, frameshift mutations, and gene fusion analysis. In addition, we propose two more efficient screening approaches, including an in-group authentic neoantigen peptides database and two more stringent thresholds. The range of candidate peptides was effectively narrowed down to those that are more likely to elicit an immune response, providing a more meaningful reference for subsequent experimental validation. Compared to ProGeo-neo, the ProGeo-neo v2.0 performed well based on the same dataset, including updated functionality and improved accuracy. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {At present, there are various treatment strategies for colorectal cancer, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy. In recent years, with the continuous development of immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can significantly improve the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer patients with high levels of microsatellite instability. In addition to ICIs, neoantigens, as a class of tumor-specific antigens (TSA), are regarded as new immunotherapy targets for many cancer species and are being explored for antitumor therapy. Immunotherapy strategies based on neoantigens include tumor vaccines and adoptive cell therapy (ACT). These methods aim to eliminate tumor cells by enhancing the immune response of host T-cells to neoantigens. In addition, for MSS colorectal cancer, such "cold tumors"with low mutation rates and stable microsatellites are not sensitive to ICIs, whereas neoantigens could provide a promising immunotherapeutic avenue. In this review, we summarized the current status of colorectal cancer neoantigen prediction and current clinical trials of neoantigens and discussed the difficulties and limitations of neoantigens-based therapies for the treatment of CRC. © 2022 Yue Zheng et al.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Despite a considerable benefit of adding immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC), a durable response to ICIs occurs in only a small minority of such patients. Methods: A total of 135 patients with ES-SCLC treated with chemotherapy either alone (chemo-cohort, n = 71) or together with an ICI (ICI combo-cohort, n = 64) was included in this retrospective study. Tumors were classified pathologically as inflamed or noninflamed on the basis of programmed death-ligand 1 expression and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte density. Immune-related gene expression profiling was performed, and predicted neoantigen load was determined by whole-exome sequencing. Results: Among patients in the ICI combo-cohort, median progression-free survival was 10.8 and 5.1 months for those with inflamed (n = 7) or noninflamed (n = 56) tumors, respectively (log-rank test p = 0.002; hazard ratio of 0.26). Among the 89 patients with immune-related gene expression profiling data available, inflamed tumors had a higher T cell-inflamed GEP score than did noninflamed tumors (−0.18 versus −0.58, p < 0.001). The 12-month progression-free survival rate was 16.1% and 0% for patients in the ICI combo-cohort harboring tumors with a high (n = 26) or low (n = 18) frameshift neoantigen load, respectively. A high-frameshift neoantigen load was associated with up-regulation of gene signatures related to antigen presentation and costimulatory signaling. A durable clinical benefit of ICI therapy was observed only in patients with inflamed tumors and a high-frameshift neoantigen load. Conclusions: Expression of programmed death-ligand 1, CD8+ T cell infiltration, and a high-frameshift neoantigen load are associated with clinical benefit of ICI therapy in ES-SCLC.

	abstract = {Purpose: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) agents and adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are prominent immunotherapies used for the treatment of advanced melanoma. Both therapies rely on activation of lymphocytes that target shared tumor antigens or neoantigens. Recent analysis of patients with metastatic melanoma who underwent treatment with TIL ACT at the NCI demonstrated decreased responses in patients previously treated with anti–PD-1 agents. We aimed to find a basis for the difference in response rates between anti–PD-1 naïve and experienced patients. Patients and Methods: We examined the tumor mutational burden (TMB) of resected tumors and the repertoire of neoantigens targeted by autologous TIL in a cohort of 112 anti–PD-1 naïve and 69 anti–PD-1 experienced patients. Results: Anti–PD-1 naïve patients were found to possess tumors with higher TMBs (352.0 vs. 213.5, P ¼ 0.005) and received TIL reactive with more neoantigens (2 vs. 1, P ¼ 0.003) compared with anti–PD-1 experienced patients. Among patients treated with TIL ACT, TMB and number of neoantigens identified were higher in ACT responders than ACT nonresponders in both anti–PD-1 naïve and experienced patients. Among patients with comparable TMBs and predicted neoantigen loads, treatment products administered to anti–PD-1 naïve patients were more likely to contain T cells reactive against neoantigens than treatment products for anti–PD-1 experienced patients (2.5 vs. 1, P ¼ 0.02). Conclusions: These results indicate that decreases in TMB and targeted neoantigens partially account for the difference in response to ACT and that additional factors likely influence responses in these patients. © 2022 American Association for Cancer Research},

	abstract = {Cancer vaccines critically rely on the availability of targetable immunogenic cancer-specific neoepitopes. However, mutation-based immunogenic neoantigens are rare or even non-existent in subgroups of cancer types. To address this issue, we exploited a cancer-specific aberrant transcription-induced chimeric RNA, designated A-PaschiRNA, as a possible source of clinically relevant and targetable neoantigens. A-PaschiRNA encodes a recently discovered cancer-specific chimeric protein that comprises full-length astrotactin-2 (ASTN2) C-terminally fused in-frame to the antisense sequence of the 18th intron of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPPA). We used extracellular vesicles (EVs) from A-PaschiRNA-transfected dendritic cells (DCs) to produce the cell-free anticancer vaccine DEXA-P. Treatment of immunocompetent cancer-bearing mice with DEXA-P inhibited tumour growth and prolonged animal survival. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that cancer-specific transcription-induced chimeric RNAs can be exploited to produce a cell-free cancer vaccine that induces potent CD8+ T cell-mediated anticancer immunity. Our novel approach may be particularly useful for developing cancer vaccines to treat malignancies with low mutational burden or without mutation-based antigens. Moreover, this cell-free anticancer vaccine approach may offer several practical advantages over cell-based vaccines, such as ease of scalability and genetic modifiability as well as enhanced shelf life. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapies provide limited benefit to patients with tumors of low immune reactivity. T cell-inducing vaccines hold promise to exert long-lasting disease control in combination with CPI therapy. Safety, tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of an individualized, heterologous chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd68) and self-amplifying mRNA (samRNA)-based neoantigen vaccine in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab were assessed as primary endpoints in an ongoing phase 1/2 study in patients with advanced metastatic solid tumors (NCT03639714). The individualized vaccine regimen was safe and well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) >10% included pyrexia, fatigue, musculoskeletal and injection site pain and diarrhea. Serious TRAEs included one count each of pyrexia, duodenitis, increased transaminases and hyperthyroidism. The RP2D was 1012 viral particles (VP) ChAd68 and 30 µg samRNA. Secondary endpoints included immunogenicity, feasibility of manufacturing and overall survival (OS). Vaccine manufacturing was feasible, with vaccination inducing long-lasting neoantigen-specific CD8 T cell responses. Several patients with microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS-CRC) had improved OS. Exploratory biomarker analyses showed decreased circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with prolonged OS. Although small study size limits statistical and translational analyses, the increased OS observed in MSS-CRC warrants further exploration in larger randomized studies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.},

	abstract = {Peptide-based neoantigen vaccines hold tremendous potential for personalized tumor immunotherapy. However, effective delivery and controllable release of antigen peptides remain major challenges in stimulating robust and sustained immune responses. Programmable DNA nanodevices provide accurate fixed positions for antigens, which are convenient for the calculation of clinical dosage, and hold great potential as precise carriers. Here, a peptide-nucleic acid conjugate was prepared, which was driven by a propargyl sulfonium-based efficient and reversible bio-orthogonal reaction under weakly alkaline conditions, and folded into regular DNA nanodevice vaccines. The well-defined nanoplatform not only exhibits outstanding stability in serum, satisfactory safety, and effective internalization by antigen-presenting cells (RAW264.7 and BMDCs) but also obviously enhances cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12) secretion for further immune response. In vivo, the nanovaccine cooperating with OVA model antigens and CpG adjuvants stimulated an antigen-specific CD8+T cell response, significantly preventing the lung metastases of melanoma. In the B16-OVA tumor-bearing model, the growth inhibition rate of melanoma reached up to 50%. Similarly, the DNA nanodevice with neoantigen induced up to a maximum degree of complete MC-38 tumor regression in 80% of mice, possibly owing to antigen peptide reversible release driven by sulfonium and further cross-presentation.

	abstract = {Lynch Syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant genetic condition that causes a high risk of colorectal cancer. The hallmark of LS is genetic instability as a result of mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency, particularly in repetitive low complexity regions called microsatellites (MS). MLH1−/− mice deficient in MMR are prone to developing tumors in the colon, upon oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), at a rate of more than 70%. Using this LS mouse model, we found a novel tumor neo-antigen from a deletion mutation of the coding MS in the SENP6 gene that prevented tumorigenesis or hindered tumor growth rate in immunized mice. This was accomplished via high throughput exome sequencing of DSS-induced colorectal tumors in the MLH1−/− mice and predicting the most highly immunogenic mutant gene products processed and presented as antigens in C57BL/6 MHC-I molecules. Throughout our study, we were able to prove the validity of the vaccine by analyzing the colorectal tumors in immunized DSS-treated mice using either our epitope, called Sp6D1, or an unrelated peptide as a negative control. Tumors developed in this context were found to be antigenic and Sp6D1-specific CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were detected by flow cytometry and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) killing assays. Additionally, immunohistochemistry showed that tumor-adjacent tertiary lymphoid organs were a potentially significant source of CD8+ lymphocytes. Altogether, our results indicate that there may be a protective effect to patients carrying LS mutations through the induction of a peptide-specific CTL response from the use of neoepitope vaccination. © 2022 UICC.},

The identification of neoantigens shared by different patients could promote the broad application of neoantigen-based immunotherapy. This study aimed to investigate shared neoantigens in esophageal carcinoma. By combining a comprehensive analysis of mutation data of 722 patients with esophageal carcinoma (EC) and in silico neoantigen prediction, we obtained 216 recurrent neoantigen candidates predicted to bind to high-frequency class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We further performed immunogenicity validation tests on five high-frequency HLA-A*0201 binding neoantigens derived from TP53 mutations. The results demonstrated that the peptides p53 H193R193_203, R248Q245_254, and R273H264_274 could efficiently prime peptide-specific CD8+ T cells to secrete IFN-γ and lyse mutant peptide-pulsed T2 cells. In conclusion, we obtained a group of shared neoantigen candidates in esophageal carcinoma and validated the immunogenicity of three novel TP53 neoantigens.

	abstract = {Background: Anti-programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD1/PDL1) therapy is an important part of comprehensive cancer therapy. However, many patients suffer from non-response to therapy. Tumor neoantigen burden (TNB) and cancer stemness play essential roles in the responsiveness to therapy. Therefore, the identification of drug candidates for anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy remains an unmet need. Methods: Three anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy cohorts were obtained from GEO database and published literatures. Cancer immune characteristics were analyzed using CIBERSORTX, GSVA, and ESTIMATE. WGCNA was employed to identify the gene modules correlated with cancer TNB and stemness. A machine-learning method was used to construct the immunotherapy resistance score (TSIRS). Pharmacogenomic analysis was conducted to explore the potential alternative drugs for anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy resistant patients. CCK-8 assay, EdU assay and wound healing assay were used to validate the effect of the predicted drug on cancer cells. Results: The therapy response and non-response cancer groups have different microenvironment features. TSIRS was developed based on tumor neoantigen and stemness. TSIRS can effectively predict the outcomes of patients with anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy in training, validation and meta cohorts. Meanwhile, TSIRS can reflect the characteristics of tumor microenvironment during anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy. PF-4708671 is identified as a potential alternative drug for patients with resistance to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy. It possesses significant inhibitive effect on the proliferation and migration of BGC-823 cells. Conclusion: TSIRS is an effective tool in the identification of candidate patients who will be benefit from anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy. Small molecule drug PF-4708671 has the potential to be used in anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy resistant patients. Copyright © 2022 Luo, Liu, Shen, Xu, Shi, Chao, Wen, Zhang, Wang, Liu and Jiang.},

	abstract = {Objective To further explore the mechanism of tumor neoantigen vaccine to treat lung cancer rat models with epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosate kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) resistance. Methods The rat lung cancer model was established by chest X-ray irradiation at a dose of 3 Gy, 3 times weekly. After EGFR-TKI treatment for 2 weeks, the tumor size of the rats did not decrease, which was regarded as the successful establishment of drug-resistant rat lung cancer model. Specific neoantigens are prepared by synthesizing and purifying peptides using standard solid-phase synthetic peptide chemistry and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The EGFR-TKI resistant rat lung cancer model was randomly divided into model group, conventional chemotherapy group [Traditional first-line combined chemotherapy, peritoneally injected pemetrexed 10 mg/(kg∙d), followed by cisplatin 0.6 mg/(kg∙d) for 10 consecutive days], neoantigen group (Specific neoantigen was injected subcutaneously for 2 times at a dose of 3 mL). The tumor size of rats in each group was detected by PET-CT, the histological changes were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, the expression of CD4+, CD8+, and CD127+ in peripheral blood lymphocytes of rats in each group was detected by flow cytometry, and the levels of interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-5 in peripheral blood were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results The tumor quality in the neoantigen group was significantly lower than that in the model group and traditional chemotherapy group (P < 0.05), and the tumor lesions in the PET-CT scanning neoantigen group showed a trend of shrinkage. In HE staining, compared with the model group and traditional chemotherapy group, the inflammatory infiltration in the lung tissues of the neoantigen group showed a significant decreasing trend, while the increase of new capillaries and the aperture of alveolar cavity showed an increasing trend. Compared with model group and conventional chemotherapy group, the expression of CD4+, CD4+/CD127+, and CD8+/CD127+ in peripheral blood lymphocytes of neoantigen group was significantly increased, while the expression of CD8+ was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Compared with model group and conventional chemotherapy group, the levels of IL-2, IFN-γ, and IL-5 in peripheral blood of neoantigen group were significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Conclusion The intervention of tumor neoantigen vaccine on EGFR-TKI resistant lung cancer rat model can effectively reduce the tumor quality, alleviate the degree of inflammatory lesions in lung tissue to a certain extent, and reduce inflammatory infiltration. By increasing CD4+, CD4+/CD127+, and CD8+/CD127+ in peripheral blood lymphocytes, and reducing the expression of CD8+ factors, play an immunosuppressive role. In addition, neoantigen vaccine can reduce the levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-5 inflammatory factors in peripheral blood, and reduce the degree of lung inflammation. © Endocrinology Research Centre, 2022.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE High tumor mutation burden (TMB) in many cancer types is associated with the production of tumor-specific neoantigens, a favorable outcome and response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Besides mutation-derived neoantigens, aberrant intron retention also produces tumor neopeptides that could trigger an immune response. The relationship between intron-retention–derived tumor neoantigens (IR-neoAg) and clinical outcomes in pancreatic cancer remains uncertain. Here, we quantify IR-neoAg in pancreatic cancer and evaluate whether IR-neoAg load might serve as a biomarker for selecting patients who may benefit from ICB therapy. METHODS We developed a computational approach to estimate patient-specific IR-neoAg load from transcriptome data available in The Cancer Genome Atlas pancreatic cancer cohort. Associations between IR-neoAg load and patient overall survival were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression. Differential expression of immune checkpoint and HLA-I genes was evaluated in tumors with high IR-neoAg load. RESULTS High IR-neoAg load predicted better overall survival in pancreatic cancer, although no association was found for TMB. IR-neoAg load remained a significant prognostic factor after adjusting for patient age, sex, tumor stage and grade, and TMB. Moreover, pancreatic tumors with both high IR-neoAg load and high HLA-I gene expression had similar gene expression profiles as other tumor types that showed response to anti–programmed cell death protein 1 therapy. CONCLUSION IR-neoAg load is associated with favorable survival in pancreatic cancer. These findings provide strong evidence for considering IR-neoAgs when selecting patients who might benefit from ICB therapy. © 2022 by American Society of Clinical Oncology},

	abstract = {Background Personalized neoantigen vaccine could induce a robust antitumor immune response in multiple cancers, whose efficacy could be further enhanced by combining with programmed cell death 1 blockade (α-PD-1). However, the corresponding immune response and synergistic mechanisms remain largely unclear. Here, we aimed to develop clinically available combinational therapeutic strategy and further explore its potential antitumor mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods Neoantigen peptide vaccine (NeoVAC) for murine HCC cell line Hepa1-6 was developed and optimized by neoantigen screening and adjuvant optimization. Then the synergistic efficacy and related molecular mechanisms of NeoVAC combined with α-PD-1 in HCC were evaluated by orthotopic HCC mouse model, single-cell RNA sequencing, tetramer flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, etc. The tumor-killing capacity of CD8 + tissue-resident memory T cells (CD8 + T RMs) was assessed by orthotopic HCC mouse model, and autologous patient-derived cells. Results NeoVAC, which consisted of seven high immunogenic neoantigen peptides and clinical-grade Poly(I:C), could generate a strong antitumor immune response in HCC mouse models. Significantly, its efficacy could be further improved by combining with α-PD-1, with 80% of durable tumor regression and long-term immune memory in orthotopic HCC models. Moreover, in-depth analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment showed that the percentage of CD8 + T RMs was remarkedly increased in NeoVAC plus α-PD-1 treatment group, and positively associated with the antitumor efficacy. In vitro and in vivo T-cell cytotoxicity assay further confirmed the strong tumor-killing capacity of CD8 + T RMs sorting from orthotopic mouse HCC or patient's HCC tissue.

	abstract = {Public neoantigens (NeoAgs) represent an elite class of shared cancer-specific epitopes derived from recurrently mutated driver genes. Here we describe a high-throughput platform combining single-cell transcriptomic and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to establish whether mutant PIK3CA, among the most frequently genomically altered driver oncogenes, generates an immunogenic public NeoAg. Using this strategy, we developed a panel of TCRs that recognize an endogenously processed neopeptide encompassing a common PIK3CA hotspot mutation restricted by the prevalent human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*03:01 allele. Mechanistically, immunogenicity to this public NeoAg arises from enhanced neopeptide/HLA complex stability caused by a preferred HLA anchor substitution. Structural studies indicated that the HLA-bound neopeptide presents a comparatively ‘featureless’ surface dominated by the peptide’s backbone. To bind this epitope with high specificity and affinity, we discovered that a lead TCR clinical candidate engages the neopeptide through an extended interface facilitated by an unusually long CDR3β loop. In patients with diverse malignancies, we observed NeoAg clonal conservation and spontaneous immunogenicity to the neoepitope. Finally, adoptive transfer of TCR-engineered T cells led to tumor regression in vivo in mice bearing PIK3CA-mutant tumors but not wild-type PIK3CA tumors. Together, these findings establish the immunogenicity and therapeutic potential of a mutant PIK3CA-derived public NeoAg. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The accurate identification of antitumor T cell receptors (TCRs) represents a major challenge for the engineering of cell-based cancer immunotherapies. By mapping 55 neoantigen-specific TCR clonotypes (NeoTCRs) from 10 metastatic human tumors to their single-cell transcriptomes, we identified signatures of CD8+ and CD4+ neoantigen-reactive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Neoantigen-specific TILs exhibited tumor-specific expansion with dysfunctional phenotypes, distinct from blood-emigrant bystanders and regulatory TILs. Prospective prediction and testing of 73 NeoTCR signature–derived clonotypes demonstrated that half of the tested TCRs recognized tumor antigens or autologous tumors. NeoTCR signatures identified TCRs that target driver neoantigens and nonmutated viral or tumor-associated antigens, suggesting a common metastatic TIL exhaustion program. NeoTCR signatures delineate the landscape of TILs across metastatic tumors, enabling successful TCR prediction based purely on TIL transcriptomic states for use in cancer immunotherapy. © 2022 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

	abstract = {The lack of tumor specific antigens (TSA) and the immune tolerance are two major obstacles for the immunotherapy of cancer. Current immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) show clinical responses in only limited subsets of cancer patients, which, to some extent, depends on the mutation load of tumor cells that may generate neoantigens. Here, we aimed to generate a neoantigen MDP to exhibit stronger anti-tumor efficacy. Methods: In this study, we utilized chemically modified sialic acid precursor tetra acetyl-N-azidoacetylmannosamine (AC4ManNAZ) to engineer the glycoproteins on the membranes of tumor cells for the covalent ligation of hapten adjuvant Pam3CSK4 in vivo, which eventually generated a neoantigen, i.e., ManNAZ-DBCO-Pam3CSK4 (MDP), on tumor cells. The high labeling efficiency, relatively specific biodistribution in tumor tissues and the anti-tumor efficacy were confirmed in the syngeneic murine models of the breast cancer and the lung cancer. Results: The generation of MDP neoantigen in tumor-bearing mice significantly evoked both the humoral and the T-cell-dependent antitumor immune responses, resulting in a strong inhibition on the growth of the breast cancer and the lung cancer allografts and significantly prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice. Interestingly, MDP neoantigen was able to dramatically increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to ICIs and greatly enhance the anti-tumor efficacy in the murine models of both breast cancer and the lung cancer, which showed no or low responses to the immunotherapy with anti-PD1 antibody alone. Conclusions: We developed a simple metabolic glycoengineering method to artificially generate neoantigens on tumor cells to enhance tumor cell immunogenicity, which is able to significantly improve the response and the clinical outcome of ICIs. © 2021 Ivyspring International Publisher.

	abstract = {Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as new therapeutic options for refractory cancer, they are only effective in select patients. Tumor antigen-pulsed dendritic cell (DC) vaccine therapy activates tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, making it an important immunotherapeutic strategy. Salivary ductal carcinoma (SDC) carries a poor prognosis, including poor long-term survival after metastasis or recurrence. In this study, we reported a case of refractory metastatic SDC that was treated with a tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccine followed by a single injection of low-dose nivolumab, and a durable complete response was achieved. We retrospectively analyzed the immunological factors that contributed to these long-lasting clinical effects. First, we performed neoantigen analysis using resected metastatic tumor specimens obtained before treatment. We found that the tumor had 256 non-synonymous mutations and 669 class I high-affinity binding neoantigen peptides. Using synthetic neoantigen peptides and ELISpot analysis, we found that peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes cryopreserved before treatment contained pre-existing neoantigen-specific T cells, and the cells obtained after treatment exhibited greater reactivity to neoantigens than those obtained before treatment. Our results collectively suggest that the rapid and long-lasting effect of this combination therapy in our patient may have resulted from the presence of pre-existing neoantigen-specific T cells and stimulation and expansion of those cells following tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccine and ICI therapy. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Endometrial cancer (EC) is a common gynecological malignancy and the fourth most common malignancy in European and North American women. Amongst EC, the advanced serous, p53‐mutated, and pMMR subtypes have the highest risk of relapse despite optimal standard of care therapy. At present, there is no standard of care maintenance treatment to prevent relapse among these high‐risk patients. Vaccines are a form of immunotherapy that can potentially increase the immunogenicity of pMMR, serous, and p53‐mutated tumors to render them responsive to check point inhibitor‐based immunotherapy. We demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of generating a personalized dendritic cell vaccine pulsed with peptide neoantigens in a patient with pMMR, p53‐mutated, and serous endometrial adenocarcinoma (SEC). The personalized vaccine was administered in combination with systemic chemotherapy to treat an inoperable metastatic recurrence. This treatment association demonstrated the safety and immunogenicity of the personalized dendritic cell vaccine. Interestingly, a complete oncological response was obtained with respect to both radiological assessment and the tumor marker CA‐125. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background Neoantigens derived from somatic mutations correlate with therapeutic responses mediated by treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Neoantigens are therefore highly attractive targets for the development of therapeutic approaches in personalized medicine, although many aspects of their quality and associated immune responses are not yet well understood. In a case study of metastatic malignant melanoma, we aimed to perform an in-depth characterization of neoantigens and respective T-cell responses in the context of immune checkpoint modulation. Methods Three neoantigens, which we identified either by immunopeptidomics or in silico prediction, were investigated using binding affinity analyses and structural simulations. We isolated seven T-cell receptors (TCRs) from the patient's immune repertoire recognizing these antigens. TCRs were compared in vitro by multiparametric analyses including functional avidity, multicytokine secretion, and cross-reactivity screenings. A xenograft mouse model served to study in vivo functionality of selected TCRs. We investigated the patient's TCR repertoire in blood and different tumor-related tissues over 3 years using TCR beta deep sequencing. Results Selected mutated peptide ligands with proven immunogenicity showed similar binding affinities to the human leukocyte antigen complex and comparable disparity to their wild-type counterparts in molecular dynamic simulations. Nevertheless, isolated TCRs recognizing these antigens demonstrated distinct patterns in functionality and frequency. TCRs with lower functional avidity showed at least equal antitumor immune responses in vivo. Moreover, they occurred at high frequencies and particularly demonstrated long-term persistence within tumor tissues, lymph nodes and various blood samples associated with a reduced activation pattern on primary in vitro stimulation. Conclusions We performed a so far unique fine characterization of neoantigen-specific T-cell responses revealing defined reactivity patterns of neoantigen-specific TCRs. Our data highlight qualitative differences of these TCRs associated with function and longevity of respective T cells. Such features need to be considered for further optimization of neoantigen targeting including adoptive T-cell therapies using TCR-transgenic T cells.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

	abstract = {Historically poor clinical results of tumor vaccines have been attributed to weakly immunogenic antigen targets, limited specificity, and vaccine platforms that fail to induce high-quality polyfunctional T cells, central to mediating cellular immunity. We show here that the combination of antigen selection, construct design, and a robust vaccine platform based on the Synthetically Modified Alpha Replicon RNA Technology (SMARRT), a self-replicating RNA, leads to control of tumor growth in mice. Therapeutic immunization with SMARRT replicon-based vaccines expressing tumor-specific neoantigens or tumor-associated antigen were able to generate polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in mice. Additionally, checkpoint inhibitors, or co-administration of cytokine also expressed from the SMARRT platform, synergized to enhance responses further. Lastly, SMARRT-based immunization of non-human primates was able to elicit high-quality T cell responses, demonstrating translatability and clinical feasibility of synthetic replicon technology for therapeutic oncology vaccines. Maine and colleagues demonstrate the use of self-replicating RNA technology, SMARRT, to deliver combinatorial immunotherapies for use in oncology. Vaccination with this platform encoding neoantigens leads to tumor regression, mediated by polyfunctional T cell responses. Additionally, SMAART encoding a surrogate viral antigen demonstrates translatability of the platform to large animals. © 2020 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy},

	abstract = {Tumor involvement of major vascular structures limits surgical options in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which in turn limits opportunities for cure. Despite advances in locoregional approaches, there is currently no role for incomplete resection. This study evaluated a gelatinized neoantigen-targeted vaccine applied to a grossly positive resection margin in preventing local recurrence. Incomplete surgical resection was performed in mice bearing syngeneic flank Panc02 tumors, leaving a 1 mm rim adherent to the muscle bed. A previously validated vaccine consisting of neoantigen peptides, a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist and AddaVaxTM (termed PancVax) was embedded in a hyaluronic acid hydrogel and applied to the tumor bed. Tumor remnants, regional lymph nodes, and spleens were analyzed using histology, flow cytometry, gene expression profiling, and ELISPOT assays. The immune microenvironment at the tumor margin after surgery alone was characterized by a transient influx of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), prolonged neutrophil influx, and near complete loss of cytotoxic T cells. Application of PancVax gel was associated with enhanced T cell activation in the draining lymph node and expansion of neoantigen-specific T cells in the spleen. Mice implanted with PancVax gel demonstrated no evidence of residual tumor at two weeks postoperatively and healed incisions at two months postoperatively without local recurrence. In summary, application of PancVax gel at a grossly positive tumor margin led to systemic expansion of neoantigen-specific T cells and effectively prevented local recurrence. These findings support further work into locoregional adjuncts to immune modulation in PDAC. © 2021 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Among tumor immunotherapies, neoantigen vaccines are in early human clinical trials and have demonstrated substantial efficiency. Compared with more neoantigens in melanoma, the paucity and inefficient identification of effective neoantigens in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain enormous challenges in effectively treating this malignancy. In this review, we highlight the current development of HCC neoantigens in its generation, screening, and identification. We also discuss the possibility that there are more effective neoantigens in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC than in non-HBV-related HCC. In addition, since HCC is an immunosuppressive tumor, strategies that reverse immunosuppression and enhance the immune response should be considered for the practical exploitation of HCC neoantigens. In summary, this review offers some strategies to solve existing problems in HCC neoantigen research and provide further insights for immunotherapy. © The Author(s) 2021.

Therefore, TNB has emerged as a biomarker for immunotherapy and other types of therapy. In the present review, the potential application of TNB as a biomarker was evaluated. The methods of neoantigen prediction were summarized and the mechanisms involved in TNB were investigated. The impact of high TNB and increased number of infiltrating immune cells on the efficacy of immunotherapy was also addressed.

These mutations can sometimes create so-called neoantigens, which allow the immune system to detect and eliminate tumor cells. However, efforts that stimulate the immune system to eliminate tumors based on their molecular differences have had less success than has been hoped for, and there are conflicting reports about the role of neoantigens in the success of this approach. Here we review some of the conflicting evidence in the literature and highlight key aspects of the tumor-immune interface that are emerging as major determinants of whether mutation-derived neoantigens will contribute to an immunotherapy response.

	abstract = {Background: Clinically, prophylactic anti-recurrence treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after radical surgery are extremely limited. Neoantigen based vaccine can generate robust anti-tumor immune response in several solid tumors but whether it could induce anti-tumor immune response in HCC and serve as a safe and effective prophylactic strategy for preventing postoperative HCC recurrence still remain largely unclear. Methods: Personalized neoantigen vaccine was designed and immunized for 10 HCC patients with high risk of postoperative recurrence in a prime-boost schedule. The safety and immune response were assessed through adverse events, tissue sequencing, ELISpot, TCR sequencing. The clinical response was evaluated by recurrence-free survival (RFS) and personalized circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing. Results: In the 10 enrolled patients, no obvious adverse events were observed during neoantigen vaccinations. Until the deadline of clinical trial, 8 of 10 patients were confirmed with clinical relapse by imaging, the other 2 patients remained relapse-free. From receiving first neoantigen vaccination, the median RFS of 10 patients were 7.4 months. Among 7 patients received all planned neoantigen vaccinations, 5 of them demonstrated neoantigen-induced T cell responses and have significantly longer RFS after radical surgery than other 5 patients without responsive neoantigens or only with prime vaccination and propensity scores matching control patients (p = 0.035). Moreover, tracking personalized neoantigen mutations in ctDNA could provide real-time evaluation of clinical response in HCC patients during neoantigen vaccination and follow up. Conclusion: Personalized neoantigen vaccine is proved as a safe, feasible and effective strategy for HCC anti-recurrence, and its progression could be sensitively monitored by corresponding neoantigen mutations in ctDNA, and thus provided solid information for individualized medicine in HCC.

	abstract = {Therapies that utilize immune checkpoint inhibition work by leveraging mutation-derived neoantigens and have shown greater clinical efficacy in tumors with higher mutational burden. Whether tumors with a low mutational burden are susceptible to neoantigen-targeted therapy has not been fully addressed. To examine the feasibility of neoantigen-specific adoptive T-cell therapy, the authors studied the T-cell response against somatic variants in five patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a malignancy with a very low tumor mutational burden. DNA and RNA from tumor (CD34+) and normal (CD3+) cells isolated from the patients’ blood were sequenced to predict patient-specific MDS neopeptides. Neopeptides representing the somatic variants were used to induce and expand autologous T cells ex vivo, and these were systematically tested in killing assays to determine the proportion of neopeptides yielding neoantigen-specific T cells. The authors identified a total of 32 somatic variants (four to eight per patient) and found that 21 (66%) induced a peptide-specific T-cell response and 19 (59%) induced a T-cell response capable of killing autologous tumor cells. Of the 32 somatic variants, 11 (34%) induced a CD4+ response and 11 (34%) induced a CD8+ response that killed the tumor. These results indicate that in vitro induction of neoantigen-specific T cells is feasible for tumors with very low mutational burden and that this approach warrants investigation as a therapeutic option for such patients. © 2020 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy},

	abstract = {Background Immunization with tumor neoantigens is a promising vaccine approach to promote antitumor immunity due to their high immunogenicity, lack of expression in normal tissue, and preferential induction of tumor neoantigen-specific T cells, which are central mediators of the anti-cancer response. A drawback to targeting tumor neoantigen-specific T cells is that these cells are found at a low frequency in patients with cancer, limiting their therapeutic benefit. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) promotes expansion and persistence of tumor-reactive T cells. However, its clinical use has been hampered by toxicities arising from its multiple cellular targets. Thus, new engineered IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) agonists with distinctive cell type selectivity have been designed to harness the potential of IL-2 for tumor immunotherapy. Methods We investigated the potential to amplify neoantigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell immune responses to promote antitumor immunity through vaccination with tumor neoantigens. Following T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated induction of the high-Affinity IL-2R on these T cells, amplification of the neoantigen-specific T cell response was achieved using a high dose of the mouse IL-2/CD25 (mIL-2/CD25) fusion protein, an IL-2R agonist with more favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics than IL-2 and selectivity toward the high-Affinity IL-2R. Results Administration of a high dose of mIL-2/CD25 shortly after antigen-dependent induction of the high-Affinity IL-2R amplified the numbers and function of TCR transgenic tumor-reactive tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1) CD4 + T cells, leading to antitumor immunity to B16-F10 melanoma. This approach was adapted to amplify endogenous polyclonal B16-F10 neoantigen-specific T cells. Maximal expansion of these cells required prime/boost neoantigen vaccinations, where mIL-2/CD25 was optimal when administered only after the boosting steps. The ensuing mIL-2/CD25-driven immune response supported antitumor immunity to B16-F10 and was more effective than treatment with a similar amount of IL-2. Optimal antitumor effects required amplification of CD4 + and CD8 + neoantigen-specific T cells. High-dose mIL-2/CD25 supported a tumor microenvironment with higher numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T effectors cells with increased granzyme B expression and importantly a more robust expansion of neoantigen-specific T cells. Conclusion These results indicate that neoantigen-based vaccines are optimized by potentiating IL-2R signaling in CD4 + and CD8 + neoantigen-reactive T cells by using high-dose mIL-2/CD25, leading to more effective tumor clearance.  © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

	abstract = {The CD155/TIGIT axis can be co-opted during immune evasion in chronic viral infections and cancer. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal malignancy, and immune-based strategies to combat this disease have been largely unsuccessful to date. We corroborate prior reports that a substantial portion of PDAC harbors predicted high-affinity MHC class I-restricted neoepitopes and extend these findings to advanced/metastatic disease. Using multiple preclinical models of neoantigen-expressing PDAC, we demonstrate that intratumoral neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells adopt multiple states of dysfunction, resembling those in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of PDAC patients. Mechanistically, genetic and/or pharmacologic modulation of the CD155/TIGIT axis was sufficient to promote immune evasion in autochthonous neoantigen-expressing PDAC. Finally, we demonstrate that the CD155/TIGIT axis is critical in maintaining immune evasion in PDAC and uncover a combination immunotherapy (TIGIT/PD-1 co-blockade plus CD40 agonism) that elicits profound anti-tumor responses in preclinical models, now poised for clinical evaluation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of neoantigens and the subsequent elicited protective anti-tumor response are particularly important for the development of cancer vaccine and adoptive T-cell therapy. However, current algorithms for predicting neoantigens are limited by in vitro binding affinity data and algorithmic constraints, inevitably resulting in high false positives. In this study, we proposed a deep convolutional neural network named APPM (antigen presentation prediction model) to predict antigen presentation in the context of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles. APPM is trained on large mass spectrometry (MS) HLA-peptides datasets and evaluated with an independent MS benchmark. Results show that APPM outperforms the methods recommended by the immune epitope database (IEDB) in terms of positive predictive value (PPV) (0.40 vs. 0.22), which will further increase after combining these two approaches (PPV = 0.51). We further applied our model to the prediction of neoantigens from consensus driver mutations and identified 16,000 putative neoantigens with hallmarks of ‘drivers’. © Copyright © 2021 Hao, Wei, Shu, Zhang, Xu and Zhao.},

	abstract = {Immunotherapy has become an indispensable part of the comprehensive treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunotherapy has proven effective in patients with early HCC, advanced HCC, or HCC recurrence after liver transplantation. Clinically, the most commonly used immunotherapy is immune checkpoint inhibition using monoclonal antibodies, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1. However, it cannot fundamentally solve the problems of a weakened immune system and inactivation of immune cells involved in killing tumor cells. T cells can express tumor antigen-recognizing T cell receptors (TCRs) or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on the cell surface through gene editing to improve the specificity and responsiveness of immune cells. According to previous studies, TCR-T cell therapy is significantly better than CAR-T cell therapy in the treatment of solid tumors and is one of the most promising immune cell therapies for solid tumors so far. However, its application in the treatment of HCC is still being researched. Technological advancements in induction and redifferentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) allow us to use T cells to induce T cell-derived iPSCs (T-iPSCs) and then differentiate them into TCR-T cells. This has allowed a convenient strategy to study HCC models and explore optimal treatment strategies. This review gives an overview of the major advances in the development of protocols to generate neoantigen-specific TCR-T cells from T-iPSCs. We will also discuss their potential and challenges in the treatment of HCC. © Copyright © 2021 Lu, Ma, Jin, Luo and Li.},

	abstract = {To develop combination immunotherapies for gastric cancers, immunologically well-characterized preclinical models are crucial. Here, we leveraged two transplantable murine gastric cancer cell lines, YTN2 and YTN16, derived from the same parental line but differing in their susceptibility to immune rejection. We established their differential sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and identified neoantigens. Although anti-CTLA-4 mAbs eradicated YTN16 tumors in 4 of 5 mice, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 mAbs failed to eradicate YTN16 tumors. Using whole-exome and RNA sequencing, we identified two and three neoantigens in YTN2 and YTN16, respectively. MHC class I ligandome analysis detected the expression of only one of these neoantigens, mutated Cdt1, but the exact length of MHC binding peptide was determined. Dendritic cell vaccine loaded with neoepitope peptides and adoptive transfer of neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells successfully inhibited the YTN16 tumor growth. Targeting mutated Cdt1 had better efficacy for controlling the tumor. Therefore, mutated Cdt1 was the dominant neoantigen in these tumor cells. More mCdt1 peptides were bound to MHC class I and presented on YTN2 surface than YTN16. This might be one of the reasons why YTN2 was rejected while YTN16 grew in immune-competent mice. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background & Aims: DNA mismatch repair deficiency drives microsatellite instability (MSI). Cells with MSI accumulate numerous frameshift mutations. Frameshift mutations affecting cancer-related genes may promote tumorigenesis and, therefore, are shared among independently arising MSI tumors. Consequently, such recurrent frameshift mutations can give rise to shared immunogenic frameshift peptides (FSPs) that represent ideal candidates for a vaccine against MSI cancer. Pathogenic germline variants of mismatch repair genes cause Lynch syndrome (LS), a hereditary cancer syndrome affecting approximately 20–25 million individuals worldwide. Individuals with LS are at high risk of developing MSI cancer. Previously, we demonstrated safety and immunogenicity of an FSP-based vaccine in a phase I/IIa clinical trial in patients with a history of MSI colorectal cancer. However, the cancer-preventive effect of FSP vaccination in the scenario of LS has not yet been demonstrated. Methods: A genome-wide database of 488,235 mouse coding mononucleotide repeats was established, from which a set of candidates was selected based on repeat length, gene expression, and mutation frequency. In silico prediction, in vivo immunogenicity testing, and epitope mapping was used to identify candidates for FSP vaccination. Results: We identified 4 shared FSP neoantigens (Nacad [FSP-1], Maz [FSP-1], Senp6 [FSP-1], Xirp1 [FSP-1]) that induced CD4/CD8 T cell responses in naïve C57BL/6 mice. Using VCMsh2 mice, which have a conditional knockout of Msh2 in the intestinal tract and develop intestinal cancer, we showed vaccination with a combination of only 4 FSPs significantly increased FSP-specific adaptive immunity, reduced intestinal tumor burden, and prolonged overall survival. Combination of FSP vaccination with daily naproxen treatment potentiated immune response, delayed tumor growth, and prolonged survival even more effectively than FSP vaccination alone. Conclusions: Our preclinical findings support a clinical strategy of recurrent FSP neoantigen vaccination for LS cancer immunoprevention. © 2021},

	abstract = {No significant therapeutic solutions for advanced cancer are available to date. However, an old idea based on usage of tumor-specific antibodies as the basis for a new vaccination form in patients with advanced tumors, has attracted recent research and is possible due to development of personalized neoantigenic vaccines. Each tumour has indeed, its own mutation content, only a small percentage are shared between patients. Technological advances and the established genome databases, allowed for a rapid mapping of mutations in the genome. The latter allows for a rational selection of targets for personalized vaccines and on-demand production of customized therapy according to the patient s individual tumour properties. This article accordingly, summarizes basic principles of vaccines for personalized neoantigens, translational research and clinical studies related to these vaccines. Finally, the future of such therapy with personalized vaccines is discussed. © 2021 Medicinska Naklada Zagreb. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Immunotherapy with neoantigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is one of the most promising approaches in cancer treatment. Using this approach, cancer vaccines can be designed to target tumor-specific mutations that are not found in normal tissues. Clinical trials have demonstrated an increased immune response and eradication of tumors after injecting synthetic peptides selected from the immunopeptidome. Although the sequence of MHC binding peptides can be predicted from genome sequencing and prediction algorithms, this approach results in large numbers of predicted peptides, requiring the confirmation by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Identification of MHC peptides by direct MS analysis of immunopeptidome is accurate and sensitive, with tens of thousands of unique peptides potentially identified from either cancer cell line or tumor tissue. Peptides with mutations can also be identified with patient-specific protein databases constructed from genome or transcriptome sequencing data. MS analysis also enables the characterization of the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of those antigens that cannot be predicted. Moreover, PTMs were found to be more efficient in triggering an immune response. In addition to reviewing recent advances in the identification of neoantigens using MS, the techniques for cancer vaccine candidate selection and formulation, vaccine delivery systems, and the potential for use in combination with other therapeutics are also discussed. It is anticipated that MS-based techniques will play an important role in future cancer vaccine development. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

	abstract = {Tumour neoantigens arising from cancer-specific mutations generate a molecular fingerprint that has a definite specificity for cancer. Although this fingerprint perfectly discriminates cancer from healthy somatic and germline cells, and is therefore therapeutically exploitable using immune checkpoint blockade, gut and extra-gut microbial species can independently produce epitopes that resemble tumour neoantigens as part of their natural gene expression programmes. Such tumour molecular mimicry is likely not only to influence the quality and strength of the body’s anti-cancer immune response, but could also explain why certain patients show favourable long-term responses to immune checkpoint blockade while others do not benefit at all from this treatment. This article outlines the requirement for tumour neoantigens in successful cancer immunotherapy and draws attention to the emerging role of microbiome-mediated tumour neoantigen mimicry in determining checkpoint immunotherapy outcome, with far-reaching implications for the future of cancer immunotherapy. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The C-terminal aminoacidic sequence from NPM1-mutated protein, absent in normal human tissues, may serve as a leukemia-specific antigen and can be considered an ideal target for NPM1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) immunotherapy. Different in silico instruments and in vitro/ex vivo immunological platforms have identified the most immunogenic epitopes from NPM1-mutated protein. Spontaneous development of endogenous NPM1-mutated-specific cytotoxic T cells has been observed in patients, potentially contributing to remission maintenance and prolonged survival. Genetically engineered T cells, namely CAR-T or TCR-transduced T cells, directed against NPM1-mutated peptides bound to HLA could prospectively represent a promising therapeutic approach. Although either adoptive or vaccine-based immunotherapies are unlikely to be highly effective in patients with full-blown leukemia, these strategies, potentially in combination with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, could be promising in maintaining remission or preemptively eradicat-ing persistent measurable residual disease, mainly in patients ineligible for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Alternatively, neoantigen-specific donor lymphocyte infusion derived from healthy donors and targeting NPM1-mutated protein to selectively elicit graft-versus-leukemia effect may represent an attractive option in subjects experiencing post-HSCT relapse. Future studies are warranted to further investigate dynamics of NPM1-mutated-specific immunity and explore whether novel individualized immunotherapies may have potential clinical utility in NPM1-mutated AML patients. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {In the past few decades, great progress has been made in the clinical application of dendritic cell (DC) vaccines loaded with personalized neoantigens. Personalized neoantigens are antigens arising from somatic mutations in cancers, with specificity to each patient. DC vaccines work based on the fundamental characteristics of DCs, which are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), responsible for the uptake, processing, and presentation of antigens to T cells to activate immune responses. Neoantigens can exert their antitumor effects only after they are taken up by APCs and presented to T cells. In recent years, neoantigen-based personalized tumor therapeutic vaccines have proven to be safe, immunogenic and feasible treatment strategies in patients with melanoma and glioblastoma that provide new hope in the treatment of cancer patients and a new approach to cure cancer. In addition, according to ClinicalTrials.gov, hundreds of registered DC vaccine trials are either completed or ongoing worldwide, of which 9 are in early phase I, 191 in phase I, 166 in phase II and 8 in phase III. Hundreds of clinical studies on therapeutic tumor vaccines globally have proven that DC vaccines are stable, reliable and very safe. However, in this process, many other factors still limit the effectiveness of the vaccine. This review will focus on the current research progress on personalized neoantigen-pulsed DC vaccines, their limitations and future research directions of DC vaccines loaded with neoantigens. This review aims to provide a better understanding of DCs biology and manipulation of activated DCs for DCs researchers to produce the next generation of highly efficient cancer vaccines for patients. © Copyright © 2021 Tang, Zhang, Zhang and Yang.},

	abstract = {Microsatellite-instable (MSI), a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response, is caused by mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) that occurs through genetic or epigenetic silencing of MMR genes. Here, we report a mechanism of MMRd and demonstrate that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) deletion or inactivation converts cold microsatellite-stable (MSS) into MSI tumours through two orthogonal pathways: (i) by increasing retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation that leads to E2F and DNMT3A/3B expression with subsequent DNA methylation, and (ii) by increasing histone deacetylase (HDAC)2 phosphorylation that subsequently decreases H3K9ac levels and histone acetylation, which induces epigenetic silencing of MLH1. In mouse models of MSS and MSI colorectal cancers, triple-negative breast cancer and pancreatic cancer, PP2A inhibition triggers neoantigen production, cytotoxic T cell infiltration and ICB sensitization. Human cancer cell lines and tissue array effectively confirm these signaling pathways. These data indicate the dual involvement of PP2A inactivation in silencing MLH1 and inducing MSI. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) genes shape our immune response against pathogens and cancer. Certain HLA-I variants can bind a wider range of peptides than others, a feature that could be favorable against a range of viral diseases. However, the implications of this phenomenon on cancer immune response are unknown. Here we quantified peptide repertoire breadth (or promiscuity) of a representative set of HLA-I alleles and found that patients with cancer who were carrying HLA-I alleles with high peptide-binding promiscuity have significantly worse prognosis after immune checkpoint inhibition. This can be explained by a reduced capacity of the immune system to discriminate tumor neopeptides from self-peptides when patients carry highly promiscuous HLA-I variants, shifting the regulation of tumor-infiltrating T cells from activation to tolerance. In summary, HLA-I peptide-binding specificity shapes neopeptide immunogenicity and the self-immunopeptidome repertoire in an antagonistic manner, and could underlie a negative trade-off between antitumor immunity and genetic susceptibility to viral infections. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background A number of different immune pathways are involved in the effective killing of cancer cells, collectively named as the ‘Cancer Immunity Cycle’. Anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade (CPB) therapy is active on one of these pathways and reinvigorates anticancer T cell immunity, leading to long-term responses in a limited fraction of patients with cancer. We have previously shown that neoantigens-based adenovirus vectored vaccine in combination with anti-PD-1 further expands pre-existing anticancer immunity and elicits novel neoantigen-specific T cells thereby increasing efficacy to 50% of tumor clearance in mice. Here we added a third component to the CPB plus vaccine combination, which is able to modify the suppressive tumor microenvironment by reducing the number of tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Tregs), as strategy for improving the therapeutic efficacy and overcoming resistance. Methods The antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1, neoantigen vaccine and Treg modulating agents, either Bempegaldesleukin (BEMPEG: NKTR-214) or an antiCTLA-4 mAb with Treg-depleting activity, was investigated in murine tumor models. We evaluated tumor growth in treated animals, neoantigen-specific T cells in tumors, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and intratumoral Tregs. Results The addition of BEMPEG or anti-CTLA-4 to the combination of vaccine and anti-PD-1 led to complete eradication of large tumors in nearby 100% of treated animals, in association with expansion and activation of cancer neoantigen-specific T cells and reduction of tumor-infiltrating Tregs. Conclusion These data support the notion that the integrated regulation of three steps of the cancer immunity cycle, including expansion of neoantigen-specific T cells, reversal of the exhausted T cell phenotype together with the reduction of intratumoral Tregs may represent a novel rationally designed drug combination approach to achieve higher cure rates. © 2021 Royal Society of Chemistry.

	abstract = {PD-1 blockade unleashes CD8 T cells1, including those specific for mutation-associated neoantigens (MANA), but factors in the tumour microenvironment can inhibit these T cell responses. Single-cell transcriptomics have revealed global T cell dysfunction programs in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). However, the majority of TIL do not recognize tumour antigens2, and little is known about transcriptional programs of MANA-specific TIL. Here, we identify MANA-specific T cell clones using the MANA functional expansion of specific T cells assay3 in neoadjuvant anti-PD-1-treated non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). We use their T cell receptors as a ‘barcode’ to track and analyse their transcriptional programs in the tumour microenvironment using coupled single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor sequencing. We find both MANA- and virus-specific clones in TIL, regardless of response, and MANA-, influenza- and Epstein–Barr virus-specific TIL each have unique transcriptional programs. Despite exposure to cognate antigen, MANA-specific TIL express an incompletely activated cytolytic program. MANA-specific CD8 T cells have hallmark transcriptional programs of tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells, but low levels of interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) and are functionally less responsive to interleukin-7 (IL-7) compared with influenza-specific TRM cells. Compared with those from responding tumours, MANA-specific clones from non-responding tumours express T cell receptors with markedly lower ligand-dependent signalling, are largely confined to HOBIThigh TRM subsets, and coordinately upregulate checkpoints, killer inhibitory receptors and inhibitors of T cell activation. These findings provide important insights for overcoming resistance to PD-1 blockade. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-bound peptides that originate from tumor-specific genetic alterations, known as neoantigens, are an important class of anticancer therapeutic targets. Accurately predicting peptide presentation by MHC complexes is a key aspect of discovering therapeutically relevant neoantigens. Technological improvements in mass-spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics and advanced modeling techniques have vastly improved MHC presentation prediction over the past two decades. However, improvement in the sensitivity and specificity of prediction algorithms is needed for clinical applications such as the development of personalized cancer vaccines, the discovery of biomarkers for response to checkpoint blockade, and the quantification of autoimmune risk in gene therapies. Toward this end, we generated allele-specific immunopeptidomics data using 25 monoallelic cell lines and created Systematic HLA Epitope Ranking Pan Algorithm (SHERPA), a pan-allelic MHC-peptide algorithm for predicting MHC-peptide binding and presentation. In contrast to previously published large-scale monoallelic data, we used an HLA-null K562 parental cell line and a stable transfection of HLA alleles to better emulate native presentation. Our dataset includes five previously unprofiled alleles that expand MHC-binding pocket diversity in the training data and extend allelic coverage in under profiled populations. To improve generalizability, SHERPA systematically integrates 128 monoallelic and 384 multiallelic samples with publicly available immunoproteomics data and binding assay data. Using this dataset, we developed two features that empirically estimate the propensities of genes and specific regions within gene bodies to engender immunopeptides to represent antigen processing. Using a composite model constructed with gradient boosting decision trees, multiallelic deconvolution, and 2.15 million peptides encompassing 167 alleles, we achieved a 1.44-fold improvement of positive predictive value compared with existing tools when evaluated on independent monoallelic datasets and a 1.15-fold improvement when evaluating on tumor samples. With a high degree of accuracy, SHERPA has the potential to enable precision neoantigen discovery for future clinical applications. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

	abstract = {Although tumor-specific neoantigen-based cancer vaccines hold tremendous potential, it still faces low cross-presentation associated with severe degradation via endocytosis pathway. Herein, a thiolated nano-vaccine allowing direct cytosolic delivery of neoantigen and Toll like receptor 9 agonist CpG-ODN is developed. This approach is capable of bypassing the endo-/lysosome degradation, increasing uptake and local concentration of neoantigen and CpG-ODN to activate antigen-presenting cells, significantly strengthening the anti-cancer T-cell immunity. In vivo immunization with thiolated nano-vaccine enhanced the lymph organ homing and promoted the antigen presentation on dendritic cells, effectively inhibited tumor growth, and significantly prolonged the survival of H22-bearing mice. Strikingly, further combination of the thiolated nano-vaccine with anti-programmed cell death protein-1 antibody (αPD-1) could efficiently reverse immunosuppression and enhance response rate of tumors, which led to enhanced tumor elimination, complete prevention of tumor re-challenge, and long-term survival above 150 d. Collectively, a versatile methodology to design cancer vaccines for strengthening anti-cancer T-cell immunity in solid tumors is presented, which could be further remarkably enhanced by combining with immune checkpoint inhibitors. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) represent the most common type of acquired bone marrow failure in adults and is characterized by ineffective maturation of myeloid precursor cells and peripheral cytopenias associated with higher rates of infection, bleeding and transfusion dependence. In higher-risk patients with MDS who relapse or do not respond after standard hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy, the 2-year survival rate is 15%. Methods: Here the authors report the feasibility and safety of a novel experimental T-cell therapy called personalized adoptive cell therapy, which selects, immunizes and expands T cells against MDS-specific mutations and is targeted to patient-specific tumor cell neoantigens. Somatic mutations serve as the pathogenic drivers of cancer, including MDS, as these transformative genetic mutations may generate novel immunogenic proteins (i.e., neopeptides and possible neoantigens) that may be targeted therapeutically. Results: The authors demonstrate that the adaptive immune system can be trained ex vivo to recognize neopeptides as neoantigens and that the infusion of culture-expanded, neoantigen-immunized autologous T cells has been feasible and safe in the three patients treated to date. Discussion: The authors report on early results from their first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial that aims to assess the safety and tolerability of this novel form of adoptive T-cell immunotherapy for HMA-refractory patients with higher-risk MDS. © 2020 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy},

	abstract = {Neoantigens play a crucial role in cancer immunotherapy. However, the effectiveness and safety of neoantigen-based immunotherapies in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly in the Chinese population, have not been well studied. This study explored the feasibility and effectiveness of neoantigens in the treatment of CRC. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome sequencing were used to identify somatic mutations, RNA expression, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. Neoantigen candidates were predicted, and immunogenicity was assessed. The neoantigens TSHZ3-L523P, RARA-R83H, TP53-R248W, EYA2-V333I, and NRAS-G12D from Patient 4 (PW4); TASP1-P161L, RAP1GAP-S215R, MOSPD1-V63I, and NAV2-D1973N from Patient 10 (PW10); and HAVCR2-F39V, SEC11A-R11L, SMPDL3B-T452M, LRFN3-R118Q, and ULK1-S248L from Patient 11 (HLA-A0201+PW11) induced a heightened neoantigen-reactive T cell (NRT) response as compared with the controls in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) isolated from patients with CRC. In addition, we identified neoantigen-containing peptides SEC11A-R11L and ULK1-S248L from HLA-A0201+PW11, which more effectively elicited specific CTL responses than the corresponding native peptides in PBLs isolated from HLA-A0201+PW11 as well as in HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice. Importantly, adoptive transfer of NRTs induced by vaccination with two mutant peptides could effectively inhibit tumor growth in tumor-bearing mouse models. These data indicate that neoantigen-containing peptides with high immunogenicity represent promising candidates for peptide-mediated personalized therapy.

	abstract = {Background: The prognosis for patients with stage II/III non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unsatisfactory, even after complete tumor resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Here, we assessed the prognostic and predictive value of immunogenomic signatures for stage II/III NSCLC in Chinese patients. Methods: A total of 91 paired resected stage II/III NSCLC and normal tissues, including 47 squamous cell lung carcinomas (SCC) and 44 lung adenocarcinomas (ADC), were collected and analyzed using whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify immunogenomic signatures for association with clinicopathological variables and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: Higher neoantigen load (NAL, >2 neoantigens/Mb) exhibited better DFS for SCC patients (p = 0.021) but not ADC patients. A benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy was correlated with lower NAL (≤2 neoantigens/Mb) (p = 0.009). However, tumor mutation burden (TMB), mutations of individual gene, oncogene pathways, and antigen presentation machinery genes, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I number and HLA-I loss of heterozygosity (LOH) had no prognostic or predictive value for DFS of SCC or ADC patients. Conclusions: NAL is a useful biomarker for lung SCC prognosis and prediction of chemotherapy responses in Chinese patients. The predictive value of NAL for adjuvant immunotherapy should be further explored in patients with resected NSCLC. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Although CD8+ T cells recognize neoantigens that arise from somatic mutations in cancer, only a small fraction of nonsynonymous mutations give rise to clinically relevant neoantigens. In this study, HLA class I ligandomes of a panel of human colorectal cancer (CRC) and matched normal tissues were analyzed using mass spectrometry-based proteogenomic analysis. Neoantigen presentation was rare; however, the analysis detected a single neoantigen in a mismatch repair-deficient CRC (dMMR-CRC) tissue sample carrying 3967 nonsynonymous mutations, where abundant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and inflamed gene expression status were observed in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Using the HLA class I ligandome data and gene expression profiles, a set of nonmutated tumor-associated antigen (TAA) candidates was concomitantly identified. Interestingly, CD8+ TILs predominantly recognized the detected neoantigen over the array of TAA candidates. Neoantigen-reactive CD8+ TILs showed PD-1 positivity and exhibited functional and specific responses. Moreover, T cell receptor (TCR) profiling identified the sequence of the neoantigen-reactive TCR clonotype and showed its expansion in the TME. Transduction of the sequenced TCR conferred neoantigen specificity and cytotoxicity to peripheral blood lymphocytes. The proteogenomic approach revealed the antigenic and reactive T cell landscape in dMMR-CRC, demonstrating the presence of an immunogenic neoantigen and its potential therapeutic applications.

	abstract = {Immune-based cancer therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) and vaccines have been increasingly studied across different cancer types. Response to such therapies depends on a number of factors such as mutational burden, neoantigen load, presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, among others. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are particularly attractive to interrogate the immune response compared to traditional assays such as qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) because they enable the discovery of neoantigens and simultaneous profiling of immune infiltration using gene expression on a large scale. Current approaches in immune profiling utilizes whole-exome sequencing (WES) for human leukocyte allele (HLA) typing and neoantigen predictions, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for filtering unexpressed neoantigens and inferring immune infiltration. They have been successfully applied to the tumor setting as there is abundant sample material to perform both experiments. However, premalignant specimens are often much smaller compared to tumors. Therefore, there is a need to explore the viability of adopting a single approach for immune, neoantigen, and mutation profiling. Here, we describe our workflow of using RNA-seq to analyze mutational burden, neoantigen load, and immune expression profile. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Personalized cancer vaccines targeting neoantigens arising from somatic missense mutations are currently being evaluated for the treatment of various cancers due to their potential to elicit a multivalent, tumor-specific immune response. Several cancers express a low number of neoantigens; in these cases, ensuring the immunotherapeutic potential of each neoantigen-derived epitope (neoepitope) is crucial. In this study, we discovered that therapeutic vaccines targeting immunodominant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I-restricted neoepitopes require a conjoined helper epitope in order to induce a cytotoxic, neoepitope-specific CD8+ T-cell response. Furthermore, we show that the universally immunogenic helper epitope P30 can fulfill this requisite helper function. Remarkably, conjoined P30 was able to unveil immune and antitumor responses to subdominant MHC I-restricted neoepitopes that were, otherwise, poorly immunogenic. Together, these data provide key insights into effective neoantigen vaccine design and demonstrate a translatable strategy using a universal helper epitope that can improve therapeutic responses to MHC I-restricted neoepitopes. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: The progress made in cancer immunotherapy and the clinical response of patients who have undergone this type of therapy have made it the fourth pillar of cancer treatment. Objective: To briefly describe the biological rationale of personalized neoantigen-based cancer immuno-therapy, the current perspectives regarding its development, and some of the clinical outcomes achieved with this therapy. Materials and methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus and EBSCO using the following search strategy: type of articles: original experimental studies, clinical trials, and narrative and systematic reviews addressing methods to identify mutations found in tumors and cancer immuno-therapy strategies based on neoantigen-based vaccines; study population: humans and animal models; publication period: January 1989-December 2019; language: English and Spanish; search terms: “Im-munotherapy”, “Neoplasms”, “Mutation” and “Cancer Vaccines”. Results: The initial search started with 1 344 records. Once duplicates were removed (n=176), 780 studies were excluded after reading their abstract and title. The full text of 338 articles was read to confirm which met the inclusion criteria, finally including 73 studies for full analysis. All articles retrieved were published in English and were mainly conducted in the USA (43.83%) and Germany (23.65%). In the case of original studies (n=43), 20 were performed in humans only, 9 in animals only, 2 in both models, and 12 used in silico methodology. Conclusion: Personalized cancer immunotherapy with tumor neoantigen-based vaccines is strongly emerging as a new alternative to treat cancer. However, to achieve its appropriate implementation, it is necessary to use it in combination with conventional treatments, produce more knowledge that helps clarify cancer immunobiology, and reduce the costs associated with its production. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

We found enrichment of TFH cell transcriptional signature correlates with GC B cell signature and with prolonged survival in individuals with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We further developed a murine LUAD model in which tumor cells express B cell- and T cell-recognized neoantigens. Interactions between tumor-specific TFH and GC B cells, as well as interleukin (IL)-21 primarily produced by TFH cells, are necessary for tumor control and effector CD8 T cell function. Development of TFH cells requires B cells and B cell-recognized neoantigens. Thus, tumor neoantigens can regulate the fate of tumor-specific CD4 T cells by facilitating their interactions with tumor-specific B cells, which in turn promote anti-tumor immunity by enhancing CD8 T cell effector functions. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Cancer immunotherapy works by stimulating and strengthening the body’s anti-tumor immune response to eliminate cancer cells. Over the past few decades, immunotherapy has shown remarkable efficacy in the treatment of cancer, particularly the success of immune checkpoint blockade targeting CTLA-4, PD-1 and PDL1, which has led to a breakthrough in tumor immunotherapy. Tumor neoantigens, a new approach to tumor immunotherapy, include antigens produced by tumor viruses integrated into the genome and antigens produced by mutant proteins, which are abundantly expressed only in tumor cells and have strong immunogenicity and tumor heterogeneity. A growing number of studies have highlighted the relationship between neoantigens and T cells’ recognition of cancer cells. Vaccines developed against neoantigens are now being used in clinical trials in various solid tumors. In this review, we summarized the latest advances in the classification of immunotherapy and the process of classification, identification and synthesis of tumor-specific neoantigens, as well as their role in current cancer immunotherapy. Finally, the application prospects and existing problems of neoantigens were discussed. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Lu, Qin, Gao, Tao, Su and Zhong.},

	abstract = {Lynch syndrome (LS) and constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) are hereditary disorders characterised by a highly increased risk of cancer development. This is due to germline aberrations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, which results in a high mutational load in tumours of these patients, including insertions and deletions in genes bearing microsatellites. This generates microsatellite instability and cause reading frameshifts in coding regions that could lead to the generation of neoantigens and opens up avenues for neoantigen targeting immune therapies prophylactically and therapeutically. However, major obstacles need to be overcome, such as the heterogeneity in tumour formation within and between LS and CMMRD patients, which results in considerable variability in the genes targeted by mutations, hence challenging the choice of suitable neoantigens. The machine-learning methods such as NetMHC and MHCflurry that predict neoantigen-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) binding affinity provide little information on other aspects of neoantigen presentation. Immune escape mechanisms that allow MMR-deficient cells to evade surveillance combined with the resistance to immune checkpoint therapy make the neoantigen targeting regimen challenging. Studies to delineate shared neoantigen profiles across patient cohorts, precise HLA binding algorithms, additional therapies to counter immune evasion and evaluation of biomarkers that predict the response of these patients to immune checkpoint therapy are warranted. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Glycans decorate the cell surface, secreted glycoproteins and glycolipids, and altered glycans are often found in cancers. Despite their high diagnostic and therapeutic potential, however, glycans are polar and flexible molecules that are quite challenging for the development and design of high-affinity binding antibodies. To understand the mechanisms by which glycan neoantigens are specifically recognized by antibodies, we analyze the biomolecular recognition of the tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen CA19-9 by two distinct antibodies using X-ray crystallography. Despite the potential plasticity of glycans and the very different antigen-binding surfaces presented by the antibodies, both structures reveal an essentially identical extended CA19-9 conformer, suggesting that this conformer's stability selects the antibodies. Starting from the bound structure of one of the antibodies, we use the AbLIFT computational algorithm to design a variant with seven core mutations in the variable domain's light-heavy chain interface that exhibits tenfold improved affinity for CA19-9. The results reveal strategies used by antibodies to specifically recognize glycan antigens and show how automated antibody-optimization methods may be used to enhance the clinical potential of existing antibodies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The use of tumor mutation-derived neoantigen represents a promising approach for cancer vaccines. Preclinical and early phase human clinical studies have shown the successful induction of tumor neoepitope-directed responses; however, overall clinical efficacy of neoantigen vaccines has been limited. One major obstacle of this strategy is the prevailing lack of sufficient understanding of the mechanism underlying the generation of neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Here, we report a correlation between antitumor efficacy of neoantigen/toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)/CD40 agonists vaccination and an increased frequency of circulating antigen-specific CD8+ T cells expressing CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) in a preclinical model. Mechanistic studies using mixed bone marrow chimeras identified that CD40 and CD80/86, but not CD70 signaling in Batf3-dependent conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) is required for the antitumor efficacy of neoantigen vaccine and generation of neoantigen-specific CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells. Although CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells exhibited robust in vitro effector function, in vivo depletion of this subset did not alter the antitumor efficacy of neoantigen/TLR3/CD40 agonists vaccination. These findings indicate that the vaccine-primed CX3CR1+ subset is dispensable for antitumor CD8+ T cell responses, but can be used as a blood-based T-cell biomarker for effective priming of CD8+ T cells as post-differentiated T cells.

The DNA vaccine was efficiently uptaken by DCs and induced effective immune response against mouse melanoma cells, leading to significant inhibition of melanoma tumor growth and reduction of lung metastasis in a mouse model. Numerous intratumoral infiltrated CD8+ T-cells with specific in vitro killing ability towards melanoma cells were identified. Our study offers evidence that a multiepitope neoantigen DNA vaccine in a nanocarrier can be exploited for personalized tumor immunotherapy and as a reliable prevalidation approach for rapid enrichment of effective neoantigens. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Glioblastoma (GBM) shows frequent relapse and is highly resistant to treatment; therefore, it is considered fatal. Various vaccination protocols that have been tested in patients with GBM, which is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, have indicated safety and efficacy, to some extent, when used alone or in combination with standard of care. Recently, neoantigen-based personalized vaccines have shown tremendous immunogenicity and safety in GBM. We aimed to systematically review the medical literature for clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoantigen-based personalized vaccines for newly diagnosed GBM. Methods: We conducted a literature search for clinical trials on PubMed, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and ClinicalTrials.gov until March 20, 2021. The primary outcomes of interest were immunogenicity and safety of the therapy. Efficacy outcomes, such as progression-free survival and overall survival, were secondary outcomes of interest. Results: Two clinical trials involving 24 patients were included in this review. High immunogenicity was observed in both studies. The GAPVAC-101 trial reported 50% APVAC1-induced and 84.7% APVAC2-induced immunogenicity with CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses in 92% (12/13) and 80% (8/10) immune responders, respectively. Two out of five patients showed CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in the study by Keskin et al. Dexamethasone use had limited immunogenicity in a trial by Keskin et al (6/8). No serious treatment-related adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Actively personalized vaccines aimed at unmutated peptides and neoantigens for patients with GBM are safe and highly immunogenic, particularly when administered in combination. Larger studies are warranted to investigate the role. © 2021 Khan et al.},

	abstract = {Cancer vaccines targeting tumor specific neoantigens derived from nonsynonymous mutations of tumor cells have emerged as an effective approach to induce antitumor T cells responses for personalized cancer immunotherapy. Despite the enormous potential of synthetic peptides as a common modality for neoantigen vaccines, their practical efficacy was limited due to their relatively low immunogenicity. Herein, we modify neoantigen peptide (Adpgk) derived from MC-38 colon carcinoma by supplementing ten consecutive positively-charged lysines (10 K-Adpgk) to obtain cationic polypeptide. And then we made them self-assemble with toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) agonist CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) adjuvant directly forming antigen/adjuvant integrated nanocomplexes (PCNPs) through electrostatic interaction for potent tumor immunotherapy. The optimal formed PCNPs were around 175 nm with uniform size distribution and could maintain stability in physiological saline solution. CpG ODN and 10 K-Adpgk in the formed PCNPs could be effectively uptake by dendritic cells (DCs) and stimulate the maturation of DCs as well as improving the efficiency of antigen cross-presentation efficiency in vitro. Furthermore, the PCNPs vaccine could markedly improve neoantigen and adjuvant co-delivery efficiency to lymphoid organs and activate cytotoxic T cells. In addition, vaccination with PCNPs could not only offer prophylactic to protect mice from challenged MC-38 colorectal tumors, but also achieve a better anti-tumor effect in an established colorectal tumor model, and significantly prolong the survival rate of tumor-bearing mice. Therefore, this work provided a versatile but effective method for neoantigen peptide and CpG ODN co-assembly vaccine platform for efficient colorectal cancer immunotherapy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The field of cancer therapy has undergone a major transformation in less than a decade due to the introduction of checkpoint inhibitors, the advent of next generation sequencing and the discovery of neoantigens. The key observation that the breadth of each patient’s immune response to the unique mutations or neoantigens present in their tumor is directly related to their survival has led oncologists to focus on driving immune responses to neoantigens through vaccination. Oncology has entered the era of precision immunotherapy, and cancer vaccine development is undergoing a paradigm shift. Areas covered: Neoantigens are short peptide sequences found in tumors, but not noncancerous tissues, the vast majority of which are unique to each patient. In addition to providing a description of the distinguishing features of neoantigen discovery platforms, this review will address cross-cutting personalized cancer vaccine design themes and developmental stumbling blocks. Expert opinion: Immunoinformatic pipelines that can rapidly scan cancer genomes and identify ‘the best’ neoantigens are in high demand. Despite the need for such tools, immunoinformatic methods for identifying neoepitopes in cancer genomes are diverse and have not been well-validated. Validation of ‘personalized vaccine design pipelines’ will bring about a revolution in neoantigen-based vaccine design and delivery. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: Reportedly, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with MHC I Class aberration are prone to poor survival outcomes, which indicates that the deficiency of tumor neoantigens might represent a mechanism of immune surveillance escape in NPC. Methods: To clearly delineate the landscape of neoantigens in NPC, we performed DNA and RNA sequencing on paired primary tumor, regional lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis samples from 26 patients. Neoantigens were predicted using pVACseq pipeline. Subtype prediction model was built using random forest algorithm. Results: Portraying the landscape of neoantigens in NPC for the first time, we found that the neoantigen load of NPC was above average compared to that of other cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas program. While the quantity and quality of neoantigens were similar among primary tumor, regional lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis samples, neoantigen depletion was more severe in metastatic sites than in primary tumors. Upon tracking the clonality change of neoantigens, we found that neoantigen reduction occurred during metastasis. Building a subtype prediction model based on reported data, we observed that subtype I lacked T cells and suffered from severe neoantigen depletion, subtype II highly expressed immune checkpoint molecules and suffered from the least neoantigen depletion, and subtype III was heterogenous. Conclusions: These results indicate that neoantigens are conducive to the guidance of clinical treatment, and personalized therapeutic vaccines for NPC deserve deeper basic and clinical investigations to make them feasible in the future. © The author(s).

	abstract = {TP53 (tumor protein p53) is the most commonly mutated cancer driver gene, but drugs that target mutant tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53, are not yet available. Here, we describe the identification of an antibody highly specific to the most common TP53 mutation (R175H, in which arginine at position 175 is replaced with histidine) in complex with a common human leukocyte antigen-A (HLA-A) allele on the cell surface. We describe the structural basis of this specificity and its conversion into an immunotherapeutic agent: A bispecific single-chain diabody. Despite the extremely low p53 peptide-HLA complex density on the cancer cell surface, the bispecific antibody effectively activated T cells to lyse cancer cells that presented the neoantigen in vitro and in mice. This approach could in theory be used to target cancers containing mutations that are difficult to target in conventional ways. © 2021 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

	abstract = {Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly lethal disease, mainly due to the late stage at diagnosis and its rapid progression. Although patients with advanced HCC can choose targeted therapy or chemotherapy, overall, the treatment response rate is extremely low and the average survival time is one year more or less. But the application of immunotherapy have led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of HCC,such as TILs (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes),Checkpoint blockade (immune Checkpoint blockade), CAR-T(chimeric antigen receptor T cells) and TCR-T (engineered t-cell receptor T cells). And recent data indicate neoantigens generated when tumors mutate are the main target of tumor-specific TILs, and they are also the main antigens mediating tumor regression in TILs treatment. Moreover, numerous evidences have revealed that radiotherapy lead to massive release of tumor antigens, which may increase the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Based on the above theory, we used neoantigen reactive T cells combined with tomotherapy to treat a patient with advanced HCC (Clinical Trial Study Registration Number: NCT03199807), who reached a long time progress free survival. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, Shao, Dong, Xu, Zou, Chen, Yan, Liu, Li, Liu and Shen.},

	abstract = {Background Neoantigen (NeoAg) peptides displayed at the tumor cell surface by human leukocyte antigen molecules show exquisite tumor specificity and can elicit T cell mediated tumor rejection. However, few NeoAgs are predicted to be shared between patients, and none to date have demonstrated therapeutic value in the context of vaccination. Methods We report here a phase I trial of personalized NeoAg peptide vaccination (PPV) of 24 stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who had previously progressed following multiple conventional therapies, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Primary endpoints of the trial evaluated feasibility, tolerability, and safety of the personalized vaccination approach, and secondary trial endpoints assessed tumor-specific immune reactivity and clinical responses. Of the 16 patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, nine continued TKI therapy concurrent with PPV and seven patients received PPV alone. Results Out of 29 patients enrolled in the trial, 24 were immunized with personalized NeoAg peptides. Aside from transient rash, fatigue and/or fever observed in three patients, no other treatment-related adverse events were observed. Median progression-free survival and overall survival of the 24 vaccinated patients were 6.0 and 8.9 months, respectively. Within 3-4 months following initiation of PPV, seven RECIST-based objective clinical responses including one complete response were observed. Notably, all seven clinical responders had EGFR-mutated tumors, including four patients that had continued TKI therapy concurrently with PPV. Immune monitoring showed that five of the seven responding patients demonstrated vaccine-induced T cell responses against EGFR NeoAg peptides. Furthermore, two highly shared EGFR mutations (L858R and T790M) were shown to be immunogenic in four of the responding patients, all of whom demonstrated increases in peripheral blood neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cell frequencies during the course of PPV. Conclusions These results show that personalized NeoAg vaccination is feasible and safe for advanced-stage NSCLC patients. The clinical and immune responses observed following PPV suggest that EGFR mutations constitute shared, immunogenic neoantigens with promising immunotherapeutic potential for large subsets of NSCLC patients. Furthermore, PPV with concurrent EGFR inhibitor therapy was well tolerated and may have contributed to the induction of PPV-induced T cell responses.  © },

	abstract = {Within the past decade, the field of immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers with the development and regulatory approval of various immune-checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies in diverse indications. Another promising approach to cancer immunotherapy involves the use of personalized vaccines designed to trigger de novo T cell responses against neoantigens, which are highly specific to tumours of individual patients, in order to amplify and broaden the endogenous repertoire of tumour-specific T cells. Results from initial clinical studies of personalized neoantigen-based vaccines, enabled by the availability of rapid and cost-effective sequencing and bioinformatics technologies, have demonstrated robust tumour-specific immunogenicity and preliminary evidence of antitumour activity in patients with melanoma and other cancers. Herein, we provide an overview of the complex process that is necessary to generate a personalized neoantigen vaccine, review the types of vaccine-induced T cells that are found within tumours and outline strategies to enhance the T cell responses. In addition, we discuss the current status of clinical studies testing personalized neoantigen vaccines in patients with cancer and considerations for future clinical investigation of this novel, individualized approach to immunotherapy. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.},

Whether low TMB cancers, which are largely refractory to immunotherapy, harbor potentially immunogenic neoantigens remains unclear. Here, we show that tumors from all patients with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer express clonal predicted neoantigens despite low TMB. Unexpectedly, these neoantigens are broadly expressed at lower levels compared to those in colorectal cancer with microsatellite instability. Using a versatile platform for modulating neoantigen expression in colorectal cancer organoids and transplantation into the distal colon of mice, we show that low expression precludes productive cross-priming and drives immediate T-cell dysfunction. Notably, experimental or therapeutic rescue of priming rendered T cells capable of controlling tumors with low neoantigen expression. These findings underscore a critical role of neoantigen expression level in immune evasion and therapy response. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.},

	abstract = {Neoantigen-specific T cells are strongly implicated as being critical for effective immune checkpoint blockade treatment (ICB) (e.g., anti–PD-1 and anti–CTLA-4) and are being targeted for vaccination-based therapies. However, ICB treatments show uneven responses between patients, and neoantigen vaccination efficiency has yet to be established. Here, we characterize neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells in a tumor that is resistant to ICB and neoantigen vaccination. Leveraging the use of mass cytometry combined with multiplex major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I tetramer staining, we screened and identified tumor neoantigen–specific CD8+ T cells in the Lewis Lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor model (mRiok1). We observed an expansion of mRiok1-specific CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) after ICB targeting PD-1 or CTLA-4 with no sign of tumor regression. The expanded neoantigen-specific CD8+ TILs remained phenotypically and functionally exhausted but displayed cytotoxic characteristics. When combining both ICB treatments, mRiok1-specific CD8+ TILs showed a stem-like phenotype and a higher capacity to produce cytokines, but tumors did not show signs of regression. Furthermore, combining both ICB treatments with neoantigen vaccination did not induce tumor regression either despite neoantigen-specific CD8+ TIL expansion. Overall, this work provides a model for studying neoantigens in an immunotherapy nonresponder model. We showed that a robust neoantigen-specific T-cell response in the LLC tumor model could fail in tumor response to ICB, which will have important implications in designing future immunotherapeutic strategies. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

The vaccine degrades quickly, so the strategy must include protection and precise targeting for immune cell stimulation. In this study, we engineered attenuated Salmonella typhimurium, which is highly infiltrative to tumors, to act as a carrier for Neoantigen peptide vaccine. Our system used a constitutive promoter vector, so that a single injection of Salmonella expressing Neoantigen could be used without requiring additional induction injections. In vivo experiments on bacteria-treated mice showed that Neoantigen expressed by the engineered carrier infiltrated tumors and resulted in suppressed tumor growth, higher survival rates and longer survival times, a relative increase of CD4 and CD8 T cells, and cytokine release. These results indicate that engineered Salmonella can be used as a carrier for Neoantigen immunotherapy. © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

However, it remains unknown whether such T cells can be isolated from and used to treat patients with glioblastoma, a cancer that is refractory to currently available therapies. To answer this question, we stimulated patient blood-derived memory T cells in vitro using peptides and minigenes that represented point mutations unique to patients' tumors (ie, candidate neoantigens) and then tested their ability to specifically recognize these mutations. In a cohort of five patients with glioblastoma, we found that circulating CD4 + memory T cells from one patient recognized a cancer neoantigen harboring a mutation in the EED gene (EED H189N) that was unique to that patient's tumor. This finding suggests that neoantigen-reactive T cells could indeed be isolated from patients with glioblastoma, thereby providing a rationale for further efforts to develop neoantigen-directed adoptive T cell therapy for this disease.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

	abstract = {Molecular-assisted precision oncology gained tremendous ground with high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS), supported by robust bioinformatics. The quest for genomics-based cancer medicine set the foundations for improved patient stratification, while unveiling a wide array of neoantigens for immunotherapy. Upfront pre-clinical and clinical studies have successfully used tumor-specific peptides in vaccines with minimal off-target effects. However, the low mutational burden presented by many lesions challenges the generalization of these solutions, requiring the diversification of neoantigen sources. Oncoproteogenomics utilizing customized databases for protein annotation by mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool toward this end. Expanding the concept toward exploring proteoforms originated from post-translational modifications (PTMs) will be decisive to improve molecular subtyping and provide potentially targetable functional nodes with increased cancer specificity. Walking through the path of systems biology, we highlight that alterations in protein glycosylation at the cell surface not only have functional impact on cancer progression and dissemination but also originate unique molecular fingerprints for targeted therapeutics. Moreover, we discuss the outstanding challenges required to accommodate glycoproteomics in oncoproteogenomics platforms. We envisage that such rationale may flag a rather neglected research field, generating novel paradigms for precision oncology and immunotherapy. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Adoptive cell therapy using TCR-engineered T cells (TCR-T cells) represents a promising strategy for treating relapsed and metastatic cancers. We previously established methods to identify neoantigen-specific TCRs based on patients’ PBMCs. However, in clinical practice isolation of PBMCs from advanced-stage cancer patients proves to be difficult. In this study, we substituted blood-derived T cells for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and used an HLA-matched cell line of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to replace autologous dendritic cells. Somatic mutations were determined in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma resected from two patients. HLA-A*02:01-restricted neoantigen libraries were constructed and transferred into HLA-matched APCs for stimulation of patient TILs. TCRs were isolated from reactive TIL cultures and functionality was tested using TCR- T cells in vitro and in vivo. To exemplify the screening approach, we identified the targeted neoantigen leading to recognition of the minigene construct that stimulated the strongest TIL response. Neoantigen peptides were used to load MHC-tetramers for T cell isolation and a TCR was identified targeting the KIAA1429D1358E mutation. TCR-T cells were activated, exhibited cytotoxicity, and secreted cytokines in a dose-dependent manner, and only when stimulated with the mutant peptide. Furthermore, comparable to a neoantigen-specific TCR that was isolated from the patient’s PBMCs, KIAA1429D1358E-specific TCR T cells destroyed human tumors in mice. The established protocol provides the required flexibility to methods striving to identify neoantigen-specific TCRs. By using an MHC-matched APC cell line and neoantigen-encoding minigene libraries, autologous TILs can be stimulated and screened when patient PBMCs and/or tumor material are not available anymore.

	abstract = {An important factor associated with primary resistance to immune-checkpoint therapies (ICT) is a “cold” tumor microenvironment (TME), characterized by the absence of T cell infiltration and a non-inflammatory milieu. Whole-exome and RNA sequencing to predict neoantigen expression was performed on the LLC1 cell line which forms “cold” tumors in mice. Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination strategies were developed using candidate neoantigen long peptides (LPs). A total of 2536 missense mutations were identified in LLC1 and of 132 candidate neoantigen short peptides, 25 were found to induce CD8+ T cell responses. However, they failed to inhibit LLC1 growth when incorporated into a cancer vaccine. In contrast, DCs pulsed with LPs induced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and one of them, designated L82, delayed LLC1 growth in vivo. By RNA-Seq, CD38 was highly expressed by LLC1 tumor cells and, therefore, anti-CD38 antibody treatment was combined with L82-pulsed DC vaccination. This combination effectively suppressed tumor growth via a mechanism relying on decreased regulatory T cells in the tumor. This study demonstrated that an appropriate vaccination strategy combining neoantigen peptide-pulsed DC with anti-CD38 antibody can render an ICT-resistant “cold” tumor susceptible to immune rejection via a mechanism involving neutralization of regulatory T cells. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Cancer vaccines are an important component of the cancer immunotherapy toolkit enhancing immune response to malignant cells by activating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Multiple successful clinical applications of cancer vaccines have shown good safety and efficacy. Despite the notable progress, significant challenges remain in obtaining consistent immune responses across heterogeneous patient populations, as well as various cancers. We present a mechanistic mathematical model describing key interactions of a personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine with an individual patient's immune system. Specifically, the model considers the vaccine concentration of tumor-specific antigen peptides and adjuvant, the patient's major histocompatibility complexes I and II copy numbers, tumor size, T cells, and antigen presenting cells. We parametrized the model using patient-specific data from a clinical study in which individualized cancer vaccines were used to treat six melanoma patients. Model simulations predicted both immune responses, represented by T cell counts, to the vaccine as well as clinical outcome (determined as change of tumor size). This model, although complex, can be used to describe, simulate, and predict the behavior of the human immune system to a personalized cancer vaccine.

	abstract = {Synthetic vaccines, based on antigenic peptides that comprise MHC−I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes expressed by tumors, show great promise for the immunotherapy of cancer. For optimal immunogenicity, the synthetic peptides (SPs) should be adjuvanted with suitable immunostimulatory additives. Previously, we have shown that improved immunogenicity in vivo is obtained with vaccine modalities in which an SP is covalently connected to an adjuvanting moiety, typically a ligand to Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). SPs were covalently attached to UPam, which is a derivative of the classic TLR2 ligand Pam3CysSK4. A disadvantage of the triply palmitoylated UPam is its high lipophilicity, which precludes universal adoption of this adjuvant for covalent modification of various antigenic peptides as it renders the synthetic vaccine insoluble in several cases. Here, we report a novel conjugatable TLR2 ligand, mini-UPam, which contains only one palmitoyl chain, rather than three, and therefore has less impact on the solubility and other physicochemical properties of a synthetic peptide. In this study, we used SPs that contain the clinically relevant neoepitopes identified in a melanoma patient who completely recovered after T-cell therapy. Homogeneous mini-UPam-SP conjugates have been prepared in good yields by stepwise solid-phase synthesis that employed a mini-UPam building block pre-prepared in solution and the standard set of Fmoc-amino acids. The immunogenicity of the novel mini-UPam-SP conjugates was demonstrated by using the cancer patient's T-cells. © 2020 The Authors. ChemBioChem published by Wiley-VCH GmbH},

	abstract = {Therapeutic cancer vaccines, an exciting development in cancer immunotherapy, share the goal of creating and amplifying tumor-specific T-cell responses, but significant obstacles still remain to their success. Here, we briefly outline the principles underlying cancer vaccine therapy with a focus on novel vaccine platforms and antigens, underscoring the renewed optimism. Numerous strategies have been investigated to overcome immunosuppressive mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and counteract tumor escape, including improving antigen selection, refining delivery platforms, and use of combination therapies. Several new cancer vaccine platforms and antigen targets are under development. In an effort to amplify tumor-specific T-cell responses, a heterologous prime-boost antigen delivery strategy is increasingly used for virus-based vaccines. Viruses have also been engineered to express targeted antigens and immunomodulatory molecules simultaneously, to favorably modify the TME. Nanoparticle systems have shown promise as delivery vectors for cancer vaccines in preclinical research. T-win is another platform targeting both tumor cells and the TME, using peptide-based vaccines that engage and activate T cells to target immunoregulatory molecules expressed on immunosuppressive and malignant cells. With the availability of next-generation sequencing, algorithms for neoantigen selection are emerging, and several bioinformatic platforms are available to select therapeutically relevant neoantigen targets for developing personalized therapies. However, more research is needed before the use of neoepitope prediction and personalized immunotherapy becomes commonplace. Taken together, the field of therapeutic cancer vaccines is fast evolving, with the promise of potential synergy with existing immunotherapies for long-term cancer treatment. © 2020 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Photothermal therapy (PTT) and neoantigen cancer vaccine each offer minimally invasive and highly specific cancer therapy; however, they are not effective against large established tumors due to physical and biological barriers that attenuate thermal ablation and abolish antitumor immunity. Here, comparative study is designed and performed using small (≈50 mm3) and large (>100 mm3) tumors to examine how tumor size affects the therapeutic efficiency of PTT and neoantigen cancer vaccine. It is shown that spiky gold nanoparticle (SGNP)-based PTT and synergistic dual adjuvant-based neoantigen cancer vaccine can efficiently regress small tumors as a single agent, but not large tumors due to limited internal heating and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). It is reported that PTT sensitizes tumors to neoantigen cancer vaccination by destroying and compromising the TME via thermally induced cellular and molecular damage, while neoantigen cancer vaccine reverts local immune suppression induced by PTT and shapes residual TME in favor of antitumor immunity. The combination therapy efficiently eradicates large local tumors and also exerts strong abscopal effect against pre-established distant tumors with robust systemic antitumor immunity. Thus, PTT combined with neoantigen cancer vaccine is a promising nano-immunotherapy for personalized therapy of advanced cancer. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of our research was to identify and evaluate synthetic phosphor-othioate-modified CPG oligodeoxynucleotides (CPG-ODNs) activating innate and adaptive immune responses. Furthermore, combined treatment with CpG and an mRNA cancer vaccine was evaluated in melanoma models as a therapeutic approach. Methods: A molecular assay was used to screen new CpG molecules; mouse modeling and pathological analysis were used to confirm the antitumor effect of CpG alone or in combination with an mRNA vaccine. Finally, safety was assessed by monitoring blood biochemistry. Results: We first screened and identified a new CpG-B class ODN (CpG2018B) that effectively stimulated type II interferons in both mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, CpG2018B promoted cytokine production mainly via toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) pathways. We further demonstrated that intratumoral (IT) injection of CpG2018B inhibited melanoma growth in syngeneic models and could turn “cold” tumors into “hot” tumors. Then, CpG2018B and an mRNA-based neoantigen cancer vaccine were encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and intratumorally injected into melanoma mouse models. Interestingly, vaccination with CpG or the mRNA vaccine alone could inhibit tumor growth, while combination of CpG with the mRNA vaccine enhanced the antitumor effect. Finally, we described the long-term safety and tolerability of CpG2018B and mRNA therapy in mice model. Conclusion: We identified a novel CpG-B class ODN to promote the immune response, and CpG combined with mRNA cancer vaccines is an attractive candidate approach for immu-nostimulatory sequence (ISS)-based therapeutic strategies. © 2021 Li et al.},

	abstract = {Background Individualized neoantigen-specific immunotherapy (iNeST) requires robustly expressed clonal neoantigens for efficacy, but tumor mutational heterogeneity, loss of neoantigen expression, and variable tissue sampling present challenges. It is assumed that clonal neoantigens are preferred targets for immunotherapy, but the distributions of clonal neoantigens are not well characterized across cancer types. Methods We combined multiregion sequencing (MR-seq) analysis of five untreated, synchronously sampled metastatic solid tumors with re-analysis of published MR-seq data from 103 patients in order to characterize their globally clonal neoantigen content and factors that would impact neoantigen targeting. Results Branching evolution in colorectal cancer and renal cell carcinoma led to fewer clonal neoantigens and to clade-specific neoantigens (those shared across a subset of tumor regions but not fully clonal), with the latter not being readily distinguishable in single tumor samples. In colorectal, renal, and bladder cancer, most tumors had few globally clonal neoantigens. Prioritizing mutations with higher purity-adjusted and ploidy-adjusted variant allele frequency enriched for globally clonal neoantigens (those found in all tumor regions), whereas estimated cancer cell fraction derived from clustering-based tools, surprisingly, did not. Neoantigen quality was associated with loss of neoantigen expression in the bladder cancer case, and HLA-allele loss was observed in the renal and non-small cell lung cancer cases. Conclusions We show that tumor type, multilesion sampling, neoantigen expression, and HLA allele retention are important factors for iNeST targeting and patient selection, and may also be important factors to consider in the development of biomarker strategies.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Derived from genetic alterations, cancer neoantigens are proteins with novel amino acid sequences that can be recognized by the immune system. Recent evidence demonstrates that cancer neoantigens represent important targets of cancer immunotherapy. The goal of cancer neoantigen vaccines is to induce neoantigen-specific immune responses and antitumor immunity, while minimizing the potential for autoimmune toxicity. Advances in sequencing technologies, neoantigen prediction ?algorithms,? and other technologies have dramatically improved the ability to identify and prioritize cancer neoantigens. These advances have generated considerable enthusiasm for ?the ?development of neoantigen vaccines. Several neoantigen vaccine platforms are currently being evaluated in early phase clinical trials including the synthetic long peptide (SLP), RNA, dendritic cell (DC), and DNA vaccine platforms. Areas covered: In this review, we describe, evaluate the mechanism(s) of action, compare the advantages and disadvantages, and summarize early clinical experience with each vaccine platform. We provide perspectives on the future directions of the neoantigen vaccine field. All data are derived from PubMed and ClinicalTrials search updated in October 2020. Expert opinion: Although the initial clinical experience is promising, significant challenges to the success of neoantigen vaccines include limitations in neoantigen identification and the need to successfully target the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Several obstacles and issues are addressed that challenge the current paradigm and inquire if neoantigens, which are essentially single-use vaccine candidates, are legitimate targets to induce protective immune responses with regard to the evolving mutational landscape. We also share insights into the striking similarities between cancer and antigenically variable pathogens and suggest that any successful vaccine against either should demonstrate a similar property: efficient induction of a diverse pool of immune cells equipped to prevent immune escape. Hence, to confront antigenic variability directly, we have employed our innovative vaccine concept, Variable Epitope Libraries, composed of large combinatorial libraries of heavily mutated epitopes, as a “universal” vaccine platform. Collectively, we offer critical analyses on key issues, which ultimately reflect on the prospective clinical relevance of personalized neoantigen vaccines which is still undefined. © 2021, L.

	abstract = {Neoantigens are considered to be ultimate target of tumor immunotherapy due to their high tumor specificity and immunogenicity. Dendritic cell (DCs) vaccines based on neoantigens have exciting effects in treatment of some malignant tumors and are a promising therapeutic modality. Lung cancer is a lethal disease with the highest morbidity and mortality rate in the world. Despite the rapid development of targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors for lung cancer in recent years, their efficacy is still unsatisfactory overall. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet clinical need for lung cancer treatment. Here, we attempted to treat lung cancer using a personalized neoantigen peptide-pulsed autologous DC vaccine and conducted a single-arm, 2 medical centers, pilot study initiated by the investigator (ChiCTR-ONC-16009100, NCT02956551). The patients enrolled were patients with heavily treated metastatic lung cancer. Candidate neoantigens were derived from whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing of fresh biopsy tissues as well as bioinformatics analysis. A total of 12 patients were enrolled in this study. A total of 85 vaccine treatments were administered with a median value of 5 doses/person (range: 3–14 doses/person). In total, 12–30 peptide-based neoantigens were selected for each patient. All treatment-related adverse events were grade 1–2 and there were no delays in dosing due to toxic effects. The objective effectiveness rate was 25%; the disease control rate was 75%; the median progression-free survival was 5.5 months and the median overall survival was 7.9 months. This study provides new evidence for neoantigen vaccine therapy and new therapeutic opportunities for lung cancer treatment. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The prognosis of Ewing sarcoma caused by EWS/FLI1 fusion is poor, especially after metastasis. Although therapy with CTLs targeted against altered EWS/FLI1 sequences at the gene break/ fusion site may be effective, CTLs generated from peripheral blood are often exhausted because of continuous exposure to tumor antigens. We addressed this by generating induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–derived functionally rejuvenated CTLs (rejT) directed against the neoantigen encoded by the EWS/FLI1 fusion gene. In this study, we examined the antitumor effects of EWS/FLI1-rejTs against Ewing sarcoma. The altered amino acid sequence at the break/fusion point of EWS/FLI1, when presented as a neoantigen, evokes an immune response that targets EWS/FLI1+ sarcoma. Although the frequency of generated EWS/FLI1-specific CTLs was only 0.003%, we successfully established CTL clones from a healthy donor. We established iPSCs from a EWS/FLI1-specific CTL clone and redifferentiated them into EWS/FLI1-specific rejTs. To evaluate cytotoxicity, we cocultured EWS/FLI1-rejTs with Ewing sarcoma cell lines. EWS/FLI1-rejTs rapidly and continuously suppressed the proliferation of Ewing sarcoma for >40 hours. Using a Ewing sarcoma xenograft mouse model, we verified the antitumor effect of EWS/FLI1-rejTs via imaging, and EWS/FLI1-rejTs conferred a statistically significant survival advantage. “Off-the-shelf” therapy is less destructive and disruptive than chemotherapy, and radiation is always desirable, particularly in adolescents, whom Ewing sarcoma most often affects. Thus, EWS/FLI1-rejTs targeting a Ewing sarcoma neoantigen could be a promising new therapeutic tool. © 2021 American Association for Cancer Research},

	abstract = {Neoantigens are derived from tumor-specific somatic mutations. Neoantigen-based syn-thesized peptides have been under clinical investigation to boost cancer immunotherapy efficacy. The promising results prompt us to further elucidate the effect of neoantigen expression on patient survival in breast cancer. We applied Kaplan–Meier survival and multivariable Cox regression models to evaluate the effect of neoantigen expression and its interaction with T-cell activation on overall survival in a cohort of 729 breast cancer patients. Pearson’s chi-squared tests were used to assess the relationships between neoantigen expression and clinical pathological variables. Spearman correlation analysis was conducted to identify correlations between neoantigen expression, mutation load, and DNA repair gene expression. ERCC1, XPA, and XPC were negatively associated with neoantigen expression, while BLM, BRCA2, MSH2, XRCC2, RAD51, CHEK1, and CHEK2 were positively associated with neoantigen expression. Based on the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model, patients with a high level of neoantigen expression and activated T-cell status showed improved overall survival. Similarly, in the T-cell exhaustion and progesterone receptor (PR) positive subgroups, patients with a high level of neoantigen expression showed prolonged survival. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the T-cell activation and PR negative subgroups. In conclusion, neoantigens may serve as immunogenic agents for immunotherapy in breast cancer. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Neoantigens are T-cell antigens derived from protein-coding mutations in tumor cells. Although neoantigens have recently been linked to anti-tumor immunity in long-term survivors of cancers such as melanoma, their prognostic and immune-modulatory role in many cancer types remain unexplored. We investigate neoantigens in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through a combination of whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), computational bioinformation, and immunohistochemistry. Our analysis reveals that patients carried with TP53 neoantigen have a longer overall survival than others (p = 0.0371) and they showed higher Immune score (p = 0.0441), higher cytotoxic lymphocytes infiltration (p = 0.0428), and higher CYT score (p = 0.0388). In contrast, the prognosis is not associated with TMB and neoantigen load. Our study draws a preliminary conclusion that it is not TMB or neoantigen load but the TP53 specific neoantigen is related to overall survival of HCC patients. We suggest that the TP53 neoantigen may affect prognosis by regulating anti-tumor immunity and that the TP53 neoantigen may be harnessed as potential targets for immunotherapies of HCC. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Neoantigens are now recognized drivers of the antitumor immune response. Recurrent neoantigens, shared among groups of patients, have thus become increasingly coveted therapeutic targets. Here, we report on the data-driven identification of a robustly presented, immunogenic neoantigen that is derived from the combination of HLA-A*01:01 and RAS.Q61K. Analysis of large patient cohorts indicated that this combination applies to 3% of patients with melanoma. Using HLA peptidomics, we were able to demonstrate robust endogenous presentation of the neoantigen in 10 tumor samples. We detected specific reactivity to the mutated peptide within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from 2 unrelated patients, thus confirming its natural immunogenicity. We further investigated the neoantigen-specific clones and their T cell receptors (TCRs) via a combination of TCR sequencing, TCR overexpression, functional assays, and single-cell transcriptomics. Our analysis revealed a diverse repertoire of neoantigen-specific clones with both intra- and interpatient TCR similarities. Moreover, 1 dominant clone proved to cross-react with the highly prevalent RAS.Q61R variant. Transcriptome analysis revealed a high association of TCR clones with specific T cell phenotypes in response to cognate melanoma, with neoantigen-specific cells showing an activated and dysfunctional phenotype. Identification of recurrent neoantigens and their reactive TCRs can promote "off-theshelf" precision immunotherapies, alleviating limitations of personalized treatments. © 2021 American Society for Clinical Investigation.

	abstract = {Head and neck cell squamous-cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are a group of common cancers typically associated with tobacco use and human papilloma virus infection. Up to half of all cases will suffer a recurrence after primary treatment. As such, new therapies are needed, including therapies which promote the anti-tumor immune response. Prior work has characterized changes in the mutation burden between primary and recurrent tumors; however, little work has characterized the changes in neoantigen evolution. We characterized genomic and neoantigen changes between 23 paired primary and recurrent HNSCC tumors. Twenty-three biopsies from patients originally diagnosed with locally advanced disease were identified from the Washington University tumor bank. Whole exosome sequencing, RNA-seq, and immunohistochemistry was performed on the primary and recurrent tumors. Within these tumors, we identified 6 genes which have predicted neoantigens in 4 or more patients. Interestingly, patients with neoantigens in these shared genes had increased CD3+ CD8+ T cell infiltration and duration of survival with disease. Within HNSCC tumors examined here, there are neoantigens in shared genes by a subset of patients. The presence of neoantigens in these shared genes may promote an anti-tumor immune response which controls tumor progression. © 2021 Impact Journals LLC. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background Recognition of neoantigens by T cells plays a major role in cancer immunotherapy. Identification of neoantigen-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) has become a critical research tool for studying T cell-mediated responses after immunotherapy. In addition, neoantigen-specific TCRs can be used to modify the specificity of T cells for T cell-based therapies targeting tumor-specific mutations. Although several techniques have been developed to identify TCR sequences, these techniques still require a significant amount of labor, making them impractical in the clinical setting. Methods Thanks to the availability of high-throughput single-cell sequencing, we developed a new process to isolate neoantigen-specific TCR sequences. This process included the isolation of tumor-infiltrating T cells from a tumor specimen and the stimulation of T cells by neoantigen-loaded dendritic cells, followed by single-cell sequencing for TCR and T-cell activation markers, interferon-γand interleukin-2. Results In this study, potential neoantigen-specific TCRs were isolated from three melanoma and three colorectal tumor specimens. These TCRs were then synthesized and transduced into autologous T cells, followed by testing the recognition of neoantigens. A total of 28 neoantigen-specific TCRs were identified by this process. If identical TCR sequences were detected from two or more single cells, this approach was highly reliable (100%, 19 out of 19 TCRs). Conclusion This single-cell approach provides an efficient process to isolate antigen-specific TCRs for research and clinical applications.  © Authors 2021},

	abstract = {Introduction. Immunotherapy based on the usage of mutant tumor neoantigens to activate the antitumor immune response is one of the most promising approaches to cancer treatment. Purpose. Evaluation of individual immunogenicity of synthetic neoantigen peptides for the B16-F10 melanoma vaccine model. Materials and methods. We studied 32 synthetic neoantigen peptides with a length of 25–27 amino acids, which were previously selected as potentially immunogenic by bioinformatic analysis of B16-F10 melanoma sequencing data and healthy tissues of C57Bl/6J mice. Groups of C57Bl/6J mice were immunized four times at weekly inter-vals with each individual peptide in combination with the adjuvant Poly(I:C), one of the groups was immunized only with Poly(I:C), and the control group was not immunized with anything. The immunogenicity of peptides was assessed by the production of interferon γ in splenocytes using the ELISpot method and by the level of serum cy-tokines Th1/Th2 using the ELISA method in immunized mice and in animals in the control group. Results. Of the 32 peptides studied, 25 caused an increase in the number of interferon-γ-producing spleen cells in previously immunized mice, but 8 of these peptides caused a non-specific increase in the production of interferon γ by splenocytes in non-immunized animals. It was found that out of 32 peptides, only 11 caused an increase in the level of serum cytokines interferon γ and interleukin 4, which are responsible for the development of the immune response along the Th1 and Th2 pathways. But only 7 peptides affected an increase in the number of inter-feron-γ-producing splenocytes and an enhance of cytokines interferon γ and interleukin 4 levels. Conclusion. Thus, the immunogenicity of 32 synthetic neoantigen peptides was evaluated, and 7 peptides were shown to activate the cellular immune response. © 2021, ABV-press Publishing House.

	abstract = {Personal neoantigen vaccines have been envisioned as an effective approach to induce, amplify and diversify antitumor T cell responses. To define the long-term effects of such a vaccine, we evaluated the clinical outcome and circulating immune responses of eight patients with surgically resected stage IIIB/C or IVM1a/b melanoma, at a median of almost 4 years after treatment with NeoVax, a long-peptide vaccine targeting up to 20 personal neoantigens per patient (NCT01970358). All patients were alive and six were without evidence of active disease. We observed long-term persistence of neoantigen-specific T cell responses following vaccination, with ex vivo detection of neoantigen-specific T cells exhibiting a memory phenotype. We also found diversification of neoantigen-specific T cell clones over time, with emergence of multiple T cell receptor clonotypes exhibiting distinct functional avidities. Furthermore, we detected evidence of tumor infiltration by neoantigen-specific T cell clones after vaccination and epitope spreading, suggesting on-target vaccine-induced tumor cell killing. Personal neoantigen peptide vaccines thus induce T cell responses that persist over years and broaden the spectrum of tumor-specific cytotoxicity in patients with melanoma. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose: While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has become a pillar of cancer treatment, biomarkers that consistently predict patient response remain elusive due to the complex mechanisms driving immune response to tumors. We hypothesized that a multidimensional approach modeling both tumor and immune-related molecular mechanisms would better predict ICB response than simpler mutation-focused biomarkers, such as tumor mutational burden (TMB). Experimental Design: Tumors from a cohort of patients with late-stage melanoma (n ¼ 51) were profiled using an immune-enhanced exome and transcriptome platform. We demonstrate increasing predictive power with deeper modeling of neoantigens and immune-related resistance mechanisms to ICB. Results: Our neoantigen burden score, which integrates both exome and transcriptome features, more significantly stratified responders and nonresponders (P ¼ 0.016) than TMB alone (P ¼ 0.049). Extension of this model to include immune-related resistance mechanisms affecting the antigen presentation machinery, such as HLA allele-specific LOH, resulted in a composite neoantigen presentation score (NEOPS) that demonstrated further increased association with therapy response (P ¼ 0.002). Conclusions: NEOPS proved the statistically strongest biomarker compared with all single-gene biomarkers, expression signatures, and TMB biomarkers evaluated in this cohort. Subsequent confirmation of these findings in an independent cohort of patients (n ¼ 110) suggests that NEOPS is a robust, novel biomarker of ICB response in melanoma. © 2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Background: Preclinical studies and early clinical trials have shown that targeting cancer neoantigens is a promising approach towards the development of personalized cancer immunotherapies. DNA vaccines can be rapidly and efficiently manufactured and can integrate multiple neoantigens simultaneously. We therefore sought to optimize the design of polyepitope DNA vaccines and test optimized polyepitope neoantigen DNA vaccines in preclinical models and in clinical translation. Methods: We developed and optimized a DNA vaccine platform to target multiple neoantigens. The polyepitope DNA vaccine platform was first optimized using model antigens in vitro and in vivo. We then identified neoantigens in preclinical breast cancer models through genome sequencing and in silico neoantigen prediction pipelines. Optimized polyepitope neoantigen DNA vaccines specific for the murine breast tumor E0771 and 4T1 were designed and their immunogenicity was tested in vivo. We also tested an optimized polyepitope neoantigen DNA vaccine in a patient with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Results: Our data support an optimized polyepitope neoantigen DNA vaccine design encoding long (≥20-mer) epitopes with a mutant form of ubiquitin (Ubmut) fused to the N-terminus for antigen processing and presentation. Optimized polyepitope neoantigen DNA vaccines were immunogenic and generated robust neoantigen-specific immune responses in mice. The magnitude of immune responses generated by optimized polyepitope neoantigen DNA vaccines was similar to that of synthetic long peptide vaccines specific for the same neoantigens. When combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, optimized polyepitope neoantigen DNA vaccines were capable of inducing antitumor immunity in preclinical models. Immune monitoring data suggest that optimized polyepitope neoantigen DNA vaccines are capable of inducing neoantigen-specific T cell responses in a patient with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Conclusions: We have developed and optimized a novel polyepitope neoantigen DNA vaccine platform that can target multiple neoantigens and induce antitumor immune responses in preclinical models and neoantigen-specific responses in clinical translation. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have made great progress in the field of tumors and have become a promising direction of tumor treatment. With advancements in genomics and bioinformatics technology, it is possible to individually analyze the neoantigens produced by somatic mutations of each patient. Neoantigen load (NAL), a promising biomarker for predicting the efficacy of ICIs, has been extensively studied. This article reviews the research progress on NAL as a biomarker for predicting the anti-tumor effects of ICI. First, we provide a definition of NAL, and summarize the detection methods, and their relationship with tumor mutation burden. In addition, we describe the common genomic sources of NAL. Finally, we review the predictive value of NAL as a tumor prediction marker based on various clinical studies. This review focuses on the predictive ability of NAL’s ICI efficacy against tumors. In melanoma, lung cancer, and gynecological tumors, NAL can be considered a predictor of treatment efficacy. In contrast, the use of NAL for urinary system and liver tumors requires further research. When NAL alone is insufficient to predict efficacy, its combination with other indicators can improve prediction efficiency. Evaluating the response of predictive biomarkers before the treatment initiation is essential for guiding the clinical treatment of cancer. The predictive power of NAL has great potential; however, it needs to be based on more accurate sequencing platforms and technologies.

	abstract = {Background: Neoantigens are critical targets to elicit robust antitumor T-cell responses. Personalized cancer vaccines developed based on neoantigens have shown promising results by prolonging cancer patients’ overall survival (OS) for several cancer types. However, the safety and efficacy of these vaccine modalities remains unclear in pancreatic cancer patients. Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 7 advanced pancreatic cancer patients. Up to 20 neoantigen peptides per patient identified by our in-house pipeline iNeo-Suite were selected, manufactured and administered to these patients with low tumor mutation burden (TMB) (less than 10 mutations/Mb). Each patient received multiple doses of vaccine depending on the progression of the disease. Peripheral blood samples of each patient were collected pre- and post-vaccination for the analysis of the immunogenicity of iNeo-Vac-P01 through ELISpot assay and flow cytometry. Results: No severe vaccine-related adverse effects were witnessed in patients enrolled in this study. The mean OS, OS associated with vaccine treatment and progression free survival (PFS) were reported to be 24.1, 8.3 and 3.1 months, respectively. Higher peripheral IFN-γ titer and CD4+ or CD8+ effector memory T cells count post vaccination were found in patients with relatively long overall survival. Remarkably, for patient P01 who had a 21-month OS associated with vaccine treatment, the abundance of antigen-specific TCR clone drastically increased from 0% to nearly 100%, indicating the potential of iNeo-Vac-P01 in inducing the activation of a specific subset of T cells to kill cancer cells. Conclusions: Neoantigen identification and selection were successfully applied to advanced pancreatic cancer patients with low TMB. As one of the earliest studies that addressed an issue in treating pancreatic cancer with personalized vaccines, it has been demonstrated that iNeo-Vac-P01, a personalized neoantigen-based peptide vaccine, could improve the currently limited clinical efficacy of pancreatic cancer.

We presented a novel neoantigen intrinsic feature-based deep learning model (neoDL) to stratify IDH wild-type GBMs into subgroups with different survivals. Results: We first derived intrinsic features for each neoantigen associated with survival, followed by applying neoDL in TCGA data cohort(AUC = 0.988, p value < 0.0001). Leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) in TCGA demonstrated that neoDL successfully classified IDH wild-type GBMs into different prognostic subgroups, which was further validated in an independent data cohort from Asian population. Long-term survival IDH wild-type GBMs identified by neoDL were found characterized by 12 protective neoantigen intrinsic features and enriched in development and cell cycle. Conclusions: The model can be therapeutically exploited to identify IDH wild-type GBM with good prognosis who will most likely benefit from neoantigen based personalized immunetherapy.

	abstract = {Over the last few decades, immunotherapy has shown significant therapeutic efficacy in a broad range of cancer types. Antitumor immune responses are contingent on the recognition of tumor-specific antigens, which are termed neoantigens. Tumor neoantigens are ideal targets for immunotherapy since they can be recognized as non-self antigens by the host immune system and thus are able to elicit an antitumor T-cell response. There are an increasing number of studies that highlight the importance of tumor neoantigens in immunoediting and in the sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. Therefore, one of the most fundamental tasks in the field of immuno-oncology research is the identification of patient-specific neoantigens. To this end, a plethora of computational approaches have been developed in order to predict tumor-specific aberrant peptides and quantify their likelihood of binding to patients' human leukocyte antigen molecules in order to be recognized by T cells. In this review, we systematically summarize and present the most recent advances in computational neoantigen prediction, and discuss the challenges and novel methods that are being developed to resolve them. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Neoantigen peptides arising from genetic alterations may serve as targets for personalized cancer vaccines and as positive predictors of response to immune checkpoint therapy. Mutations in genes regulating RNA splicing are common in hematological malignancies leading to dysregulated splicing and intron retention (IR). In this study, we investigated IR as a potential source of tumor neoantigens in multiple myeloma (MM) patients and the relationship of IR-induced neoantigens (IR-neoAg) with clinical outcomes. MM-specific IR events were identified in RNA-sequencing data from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation CoMMpass study after removing IR events that also occurred in normal plasma cells. We quantified the IR-neoAg load by assessing IR-induced novel peptides that were predicted to bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. We found that high IR-neoAg load was associated with poor overall survival in both newly diagnosed and relapsed MM patients. Further analyses revealed that poor outcome in MM patients with high IR-neoAg load was associated with high expression levels of T-cell co-inhibitory molecules and elevated interferon signaling activity. We also found that MM cells exhibiting high IR levels had lower MHC-II protein abundance and treatment of MM cells with a spliceosome inhibitor resulted in increased MHC-I protein abundance. Our findings suggest that IR-neoAg may represent a novel biomarker of MM patient clinical outcome and further that targeting RNA splicing may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent MM immune escape and promote response to checkpoint blockade. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background/Aim: Neoantigens are tumor-specific antigens that emerge due to gene mutations in tumor cells, and are highly antigenic epitopes that escape central immune tolerance in the thymus, making cancer vaccine therapy a desirable option. Patients and Methods: Tumor neoantigens were predicted in 17 patients with advanced cancer. They were resistant to the standard treatment regime, and their synthetic peptides were pulsed to the patient's monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), and administered to the patient's lymph nodes via ultrasound. Results: Some patients showed sustained tumor shrinkage after this treatment, while some did not respond, showing no ELISpot reaction. Although the number of mutations and the predicted neoantigen epitopes differed between patients, the clinical effect depended more on the presence or absence of an immune response after vaccination rather than the number of neoantigens. Conclusion: Intranodal neoantigen peptide-pulsed DC vaccine administration therapy has clinical and immunological efficacy and safety. © 2021 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

	abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological malignancy caused by clonal expansion of myeloid progenitor cells. Most patients with AML respond to chemotherapy, but relapses often occur and infer a very poor prognosis. Thirty to thirty-five percent of AMLs carry a four base pair insertion in the nucleophosmin 1 gene (NPM1) with a C-terminal alternative reading frame of 11 amino acids. We previously identified various neopeptides from the alternative reading frame of mutant NPM1 (dNPM1) on primary AML and isolated an HLA-A*02:01-restricted T-cell receptor (TCR) that enables human T-cells to kill AML cells upon retroviral gene transfer. Here, we isolated T-cells recognizing the dNPM1 peptide AVEEVSLRK presented in HLA-A*11:01. The TCR cloned from a T-cell clone recognizing HLA-A*11:01+ primary AML cells conferred in vitro recognition and lysis of AML upon transfer to CD8 cells, but failed to induce an anti-tumor effect in immunodeficient NSG mice engrafted with dNPM1 OCI-AML3 cells. In conclusion, our data show that AVEEVSLRK is a dNPM1 neoantigen on HLA-A*11:01+ primary AMLs. CD8 cells transduced with an HLA-A*11:01-restricted TCR for dNPM1 were reactive against AML in vitro. The absence of reactivity in a preclinical mouse model requires further preclinical testing to predict the potential efficacy of this TCR in clinical development. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {High-throughput genome sequencing and computation have enabled rapid identification of targets for personalized medicine, including cancer vaccines. Synthetic peptides are an established mode of cancer vaccine delivery, but generating the peptides for each patient in a rapid and affordable fashion remains difficult. High-throughput peptide synthesis technology is therefore urgently needed for patient-specific cancer vaccines to succeed in the clinic. Previously, we developed automated flow peptide synthesis technology that greatly accelerates the production of synthetic peptides. Herein, we show that this technology permits the synthesis of high-quality peptides for personalized medicine. Automated flow synthesis produces 30-mer peptides in less than 35 minutes and 15- to 16-mer peptides in less than 20 minutes. The purity of these peptides is comparable with or higher than the purity of peptides produced by other methods. This work illustrates how automated flow synthesis technology can enable customized peptide therapies by accelerating synthesis and increasing purity. We envision that implementing this technology in clinical settings will greatly increase capacity to generate clinical-grade peptides on demand, which is a key step in reaching the full potential of personalized vaccines for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Methods: We divided 812 Pan-Gyn cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas into three groups based on 60 and 80% of their load percentile. We then correlated the identified NAL subgroups with gene expression, somatic mutation, DNA methylation, and clinicopathological information. We also characterized each subgroup by distinct immune cell enrichment, PD-1 signaling, and cytolytic activity. Finally, we predicted the response of each subgroup to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Results: Across Pan-Gyn cancers, we identified three distinct NAL subgroups. These subgroups showed differences in biological function, genetic information, clinical variables, and immune infiltration. Eighty percent was identified as a meaningful cutoff point for NAL. In all patients, a higher NAL (top 20%) was associated with better overall survival as well as high immune infiltration and low intra-tumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, an interesting lncRNA named AC092580.4 was found, which was associated with two significantly different immune genes (CXCL9 and CXCL13). Conclusions: Our novel findings provide further insights into the NAL of Pan-Gyn cancers and may open up novel opportunities for their exploitation toward personalized treatment with immunotherapy. © Copyright © 2020 Zhu, Meng, Ruan, Lu, Yan and Wang.},

	abstract = {Chemorefractory ovarian cancer has limited therapeutic options. Hence, new types of treatment including neoantigen-specific immunotherapy need to be investigated. Neoantigens represent promising targets for personalized cancer immunotherapy. We here describe the clinical and immunological effects of a neoantigen peptide-loaded DC-based immunotherapy in a patient with recurrent and chemoresistant ovarian cancer. A 71-year-old female patient with chemorefractory ovarian cancer and malignant ascites received intranodal vaccination of DCs loaded with four neoantigen peptides that were predicted by our immunogenomic pipeline. Following four rounds of vaccinations with this therapy, CA-125 levels were remarkably declined and tumor cells in the ascites were also decreased. Concordantly, the tumor-related symptoms such as respiratory discomfort improved without any adverse reactions. The reactivity against one HLA-A2402-restricted neoantigen peptide derived from a mutated PPM1 F protein was detected in lymphocytes from peripheral blood by IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. Furthermore, the neoantigen (PPM1 F mutant)-specific TCRs were detected in the tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes post-vaccination. Our results showed that vaccination with intranodal injection of neoantigen peptide-loaded DCs may have clinical and immunological impacts on cancer treatment. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: Cancer vaccines provide a complex source of neoantigens. Still, increasing evidence reveals that the neoantigen quality rather than the quantity is predictive for treatment outcome. Methods: Using the preclinical Mlh1−/− tumor model, we performed a side-by side comparison of two autologous cell-line derived tumor lysates (namely 328 and A7450 T1 M1) harboring different tumor mutational burden (TMB; i.e. ultra-high: 328; moderate-high: A7450 T1 M1). Mice received repetitive prophylactic or therapeutic applications of the vaccine. Tumor incidence, immune responses and tumor microenvironment was examined. Results: Both tumor cell lysates delayed tumor formation in the prophylactic setting, with the A7450 T1 M1 lysate being more effective in decelerating tumor growth than the 328 lysate (median overall survival: 37 vs. 25 weeks). Comparable results were achieved in therapeutic setting and could be traced back to antigen-driven immune stimulation. Reactive T cells isolated from A7450 T1 M1-treated mice recognized autologous Mlh1−/− tumor cells in IFNγ ELISpot, but likewise YAC-1 cells, indicative for stimulation of both arms of the immune system. By deciphering local effects, vaccines shaped the tumor microenvironment differently. While A7450 T1 M1 prophylactically vaccinated tumors harbored low numbers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and elevated CD8-T cell infiltrates, vaccination with the 328 lysate evoked MDSC infiltration. Similar effects were seen in the therapeutic setting with stable disease induction only upon A7450 T1 M1 vaccination. Untangling individual response profiles revealed strong infiltration with LAG3+ and PD-L1+ immune cells when treatments failed, but almost complete exclusion of checkpoint-expressing lymphocytes in long-term survivors. Conclusions: By applying two tumor cell lysates we demonstrate that neoantigen quality outranks quantity. This should be considered prior to designing cancer vaccine-based combination approaches. © 2020, The Author(s).},

To enrich for neoantigens with the greatest likelihood of immunogenicity, we developed an analytic method to parse neoantigen quality through rational biological criteria across five clinical datasets for 318 cancer patients. We explored four quality metrics, including analysis of dissimilarity to the non-mutated proteome that was predictive of peptide immunogenicity. In patient tumors, neoantigens with high dissimilarity were unique, enriched for hydrophobic sequences, and correlated with survival after PD-1 checkpoint therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer independent of predicted MHC affinity. We incorporated our neoantigen quality analysis methodology into an open-source tool, antigen.garnish, to predict immunogenic peptides from bulk computationally predicted neoantigens for which the immunogenic “hit rate” is currently low. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.; Richman et al. identify dissimilarity to the non-mutated proteome as a predictor of peptide immunogenicity.

	abstract = {Many approaches to identify therapeutically relevant neoantigens couple tumor sequencing with bioinformatic algorithms and inferred rules of tumor epitope immunogenicity. However, there are no reference data to compare these approaches, and the parameters governing tumor epitope immunogenicity remain unclear. Here, we assembled a global consortium wherein each participant predicted immunogenic epitopes from shared tumor sequencing data. 608 epitopes were subsequently assessed for T cell binding in patient-matched samples. By integrating peptide features associated with presentation and recognition, we developed a model of tumor epitope immunogenicity that filtered out 98% of non-immunogenic peptides with a precision above 0.70. Pipelines prioritizing model features had superior performance, and pipeline alterations leveraging them improved prediction performance. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 310 epitopes prioritized from tumor sequencing data and assessed for T cell binding. This data resource enables identification of parameters underlying effective anti-tumor immunity and is available to the research community. Genomic tumor sequencing data with matched measurements of tumor epitope immunogenicity allows for insights into the governing parameters of epitope immunogenicity and generation of models for effective neoantigen prediction. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Neoantigens generated in neoplasms are a type of protein completely absent in healthy tissues. Therefore, anti-tumor immunity targeting neoantigens is highly specific, which provides an optional approach to boost tumor immunotherapy. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignancies in humans, with few efficient treatments to improve its prognosis. Therefore, immunotherapies reinforced by neoantigen-based strategies should be considered. In PDAC, the mutational burden is intermediate compared with other common malignancies, while the naturally formed tumor immunity is significantly inferior. Moreover, the high mutation load in PDAC correlates with a poor clinical prognosis, although the combination of a large mutation repertoire and competent T cell population is indispensable for long-term survival. In clinical practice, three strategies have been mainly used: peptide or tumor cell vaccines, neo-epitope-coding nucleotide vaccines, and dendritic cell vaccines. However, three major problems remain to be addressed, including (1) highly personalized protocols after sampling, (2) insufficient neoantigen quantity, and (3) ineffective immunotherapy of PDAC. In summary, neoantigen-based therapy of PDAC is increasing and the treatment methods are accompanied by great challenges. Currently, extensive development is needed for effective neoantigen-based therapy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: The use of next-generation sequencing technologies has enabled the rapid identification of non-synonymous somatic mutations in cancer cells. Neoantigens are mutated peptides derived from somatic mutations not present in normal tissues that may result in the presentation of tumour-specific peptides capable of eliciting antitumour T-cell responses. Personalised neoantigen-based cancer vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies have been shown to prime host immunity against tumour cells and are under clinical trial development. However, the optimisation and standardisation of neoantigen identification, as well as its delivery as immunotherapy are needed to increase tumour-specific T-cell responses and, thus, the clinical efficacy of current cancer immunotherapies. Methods: In this recommendation article, launched by the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), we outline and discuss the available framework for neoantigen prediction and present a systematic review of the current scientific evidence. Results: A number of computational pipelines for neoantigen prediction are available. Most of them provide peptide major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding affinity predictions, but more recent approaches incorporate additional features like variant allele fraction, gene expression, and clonality of mutations. Neoantigens can be predicted in all cancer types with high and low tumour mutation burden, in part by exploiting tumour-specific aberrations derived from mutational frameshifts, splice variants, gene fusions, endogenous retroelements and other tumour-specific processes that could yield more potently immunogenic tumour neoantigens. Ongoing clinical trials will highlight those cancer types and combinations of immune therapies that would derive the most benefit from neoantigen-based immunotherapies. Conclusions: Improved identification, selection and prioritisation of tumour-specific neoantigens are needed to increase the scope of benefit from cancer vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies. Novel pipelines are being developed to resolve the challenges posed by high-throughput sequencing and to predict immunogenic neoantigens. © 2020 European Society for Medical Oncology},

	abstract = {Tumor neoantigens are ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy as they are recognized by host immune system as foreigners and can elicit tumor-specific immune responses. However, existing strategies utilizing RNA or long peptides for the neoantigen vaccines render limited immune responses since only 20–30% of neoantigens predicted in silico to bind MHC I molecules are capable of eliciting immune responses with the majority of responding T cells are CD4+. Therefore, it warrants further exploration to enhance neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells responses. Since neoantigens are naturally weak antigens, we asked whether foreign T help epitopes could enhance their immunogenicity. In present study, we chose 4 weak B16F10 neoantigens as vaccine targets, and fused them to the transmembrane domain of diphtheria toxin, namely DTT-neoAg. Strikingly, the vaccine elicited anti-tumor CD8+ T cells responses and enhanced tumor infiltration of both T cells and NK cells. Impressively, DTT-neoAg vaccine significantly deterred tumor growth with the inhibition rate reached 88% in the preventive model and 100% in the therapeutic model at low dose of tumor challenge. Furthermore, after second challenge with higher dose of tumor cells, 33.3% of the immunized mice remained tumor-free for 6 months in the therapeutic model. Because DTT is a non-toxic domain of diphtheria toxin, it may be not of great concern in terms of safety as a Th epitope provider. Thus, the fusion strategy employed by this study may become a feasible and powerful approach for development of personalized cancer vaccines. © Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Lin, Wan, Cai, Deng and Li.},

	abstract = {Background: The efficacy of checkpoint blockade immunotherapies in colorectal cancer is currently restricted to a minority of patients diagnosed with mismatch repair-deficient tumors having high mutation burden. However, this observation does not exclude the existence of neoantigen-specific T cells in colorectal cancers with low mutation burden and the exploitation of their anti-cancer potential for immunotherapy. Therefore, we investigated whether autologous neoantigen-specific T cell responses could also be observed in patients diagnosed with mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers. Methods: Whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing were performed on cancer and normal tissues from seven colorectal cancer patients diagnosed with mismatch repair-proficient tumors to detect putative neoantigens. Corresponding neo-epitopes were synthesized and tested for recognition by in vitro expanded T cells that were isolated from tumor tissues (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) and from peripheral mononuclear blood cells stimulated with tumor material. Results: Neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity was detected to several neo-epitopes in the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of three patients while their respective cancers expressed 15, 21, and 30 non-synonymous variants. Cell sorting of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes based on the co-expression of CD39 and CD103 pinpointed the presence of neoantigen-specific T cells in the CD39+CD103+ T cell subset. Strikingly, the tumors containing neoantigen-reactive TIL were classified as consensus molecular subtype 4 (CMS4), which is associated with TGF-β pathway activation and worse clinical outcome. Conclusions: We have detected neoantigen-targeted reactivity by autologous T cells in mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancers of the CMS4 subtype. These findings warrant the development of specific immunotherapeutic strategies that selectively boost the activity of neoantigen-specific T cells and target the TGF-β pathway to reinforce T cell reactivity in this patient group. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background Traditional tumor thermal ablations, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoablation, can result in good local control of tumor, but traditional tumor thermal ablations are limited by poor long-term survival due to the failure of control of distal metastasis. Our previous studies developed a novel cryo-thermal therapy to treat the B16F10 melanoma mouse model. Long-term survival and T-cell-mediated durable antitumor immunity were achieved after cryo-thermal therapy, but whether tumor antigen-specific T-cells were augmented by cryo-thermal therapy was not determined. Methods The long-term antitumor therapeutic efficacy of cryo-thermal therapy was performed in B16F10 murine melanoma models. Splenocytes derived from mice treated with RFA or cryo-thermal therapy were coincubated with tumor antigen peptides to detect the frequency of antigen specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells by flow cytometry. Splenocytes were then stimulated and expanded by αCD3 or peptides and adoptive T-cell therapy experiments were performed to identify the antitumor efficacy of T-cells induced by RFA and cryo-thermal therapy. Naïve mice and tumor-bearing mice were used as control groups. Results Local cryo-thermal therapy generated a stronger systematic antitumor immune response than RFA and a long-lasting antitumor immunity that protected against tumor rechallenge. In vitro studies showed that the antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell response was induced by both cryo-thermal therapy and RFA, but the strong neoantigen-specific CD4 + T-cell response was only induced by cryo-thermal therapy. Cryo-thermal therapy-induced strong antitumor immune response was mainly mediated by CD4 + T-cells, particularly neoantigen-specific CD4 + T-cells. Conclusion Cryo-thermal therapy induced a stronger and broader antigen-specific memory T-cells. Specifically, cryo-thermal therapy, but not RFA, led to a strong neoantigen-specific CD4 + T-cell response that mediated the resistance to tumor challenge.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

	abstract = {Cancer is a heterogeneous disease and its treatment remains unsatisfactory with inconstant therapeutic responses. This variability could be related, at least in part, to different and highly personalized gut microbiota compositions. Different studies have shown an impact of microbiota on antitumor therapy. It has been demonstrated that some gut bacteria influences the development and differentiation of immune cells, suggesting that different microbiota compositions could affect the efficacy of the antitumor vaccine. Emerging data suggest that recognition of neoantigens for the generation of neoantigen cancer vaccines (NCVs) could have a key role in the activity of clinical immunotherapies. However, it is still unknown whether there is a crosstalk between microbiota and NCV. This study aimed to understand the possible mechanisms of interaction between gut microbiota and NCV delivered by DNA-electroporation (DNA-EP). We found that decreased microbiota diversity induced by prolonged antibiotic (ATB) treatment is associated with higher intratumor specific immune responses and consequently to a better antitumor effect induced by NCV delivered by DNA-EP. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, for which there is no cure. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been tried in MF but the results have been inconsistent. To gain insight into the immunogenicity of MF we characterized the neoantigen landscape of this lymphoma, focusing on the known predictors of responses to immunotherapy: the quantity, HLA-binding strength and subclonality of neoantigens. Methods: Whole exome and whole transcriptome sequences were obtained from 24 MF samples (16 plaques, 8 tumors) from 13 patients. Bioinformatic pipelines (Mutect2, OptiType, MuPeXi) were used for mutation calling, HLA typing, and neoantigen prediction. PhyloWGS was used to subdivide malignant cells into stem and clades, to which neoantigens were matched to determine their clonality. Results: MF has a high mutational load (median 3,217 non synonymous mutations), resulting in a significant number of total neoantigens (median 1,309 per sample) and high-affinity neoantigens (median 328). In stage I disease most neoantigens were clonal but with stage progression, 75% of lesions had >50% subclonal antigens and 53% lesions had CSiN scores <1. There was very little overlap in neoantigens across patients or between different lesions on the same patient, indicating a high degree of heterogeneity. Conclusions: The neoantigen landscape of MF is characterized by high neoantigen load and significant subclonality which could indicate potential challenges for immunotherapy in patients with advanced-stage disease. © Copyright © 2020 Sivanand, Hennessey, Iyer, O’Keefe, Surmanowicz, Vaid, Xiao and Gniadecki.},

	abstract = {Neoantigen-based cancer immunotherapies hold the promise of being a truly personalized, effective treatment for diverse cancer types. ELISPOT assays, as a powerful experimental technique, can verify the existence of antigen specific T cells to support basic clinical research and monitor clinical trials. However, despite the high sensitivity of ELISPOT assays, detecting immune responses of neoantigen specific T cells in a patient or healthy donor's PBMCs is still extremely difficult, since the frequency of these T cells can be very low. We developed a novel experimental method, by co-stimulation of T cells with anti-CD28 and IL-2 at the beginning of ELISPOT, to further increase the sensitivity of ELISPOT and mitigate the challenge introduced by low frequency T cells. Under the optimal concentration of 1 μg/ml for anti-CD28 and 1 U/ml for IL-2, an 11.7-fold increase of T cell response against CMV peptide was observed by using our method, and it outperforms other cytokine stimulation alternatives (5–10 folds). We also showed that this method can be effectively applied to detect neoantigen-specific T cells in healthy donors' and a melanoma patient's PBMCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that the co-stimulation of anti-CD28 and IL-2 is able to significantly improve the sensitivity of ELISPOT assays, indicating that anti-CD28 and IL-2 signaling can act in synergy to lower the T cell activation threshold and trigger more neoantigen-specific T cells. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with tumor-specific T cells can mediate cancer regression. The main target of tumor-specific T cells are neoantigens arising from mutations in self-proteins. Although the majority of cancer neoantigens are unique to each patient, and therefore not broadly useful for ACT, some are shared. We studied oligoclonal T-cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize a shared neoepitope arising from a driver mutation in the p53 oncogene (p53R175H) presented by HLA-A2. Here we report structures of wild-type and mutant p53–HLA-A2 ligands, as well as structures of three tumor-specific TCRs bound to p53R175H–HLA-A2. These structures reveal how a driver mutation in p53 rendered a self-peptide visible to T cells. The TCRs employ structurally distinct strategies that are highly focused on the mutation to discriminate between mutant and wild-type p53. The TCR–p53R175H–HLA-A2 complexes provide a framework for designing TCRs to improve potency for ACT without sacrificing specificity. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is poorly immunogenic, with limited neoantigens that can be targeted by cancer vaccine. Previous approaches to upregulate neoantigen have had limited success. In this study, we investigated the role of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC), in inducing cancer testis antigen (CTA) expression and evaluated the antitumor efficacy of a combinatorial approach with an epigenetically regulated cancer vaccine EpiGVAX and DAC. A murine model of metastatic CRC treated with combination therapy with an irradiated whole-cell CRC vaccine (GVAX) and DAC was used to assess the antitumor efficacy. DAC significantly induced expression of CTAs in CRC, including a new CTA Tra-P1A with a known neoepitope, P1A. Epigenetically modified EpiGVAX with DAC improved survival outcomes of GVAX. Using the epigenetically regulated antigen Tra-P1A as an example, our study suggests that the improved efficacy of EpiGVAX with DAC may due in part to the enhanced antigen-specific antitumor immune responses. This study shows that epigenetic therapy with DNMTi can not only induce new CTA expression but may also sensitize tumor cells for immunotherapy. Neoantigen-based EpiGVAX combined with DAC can improve the antitumor efficacy of GVAX by inducing antigen-specific antitumor T cell responses to epigenetically regulated proteins. © 2020, American Society for Clinical Investigation.},

	abstract = {T cells use highly diverse receptors (TCRs) to identify tumor cells presenting neoantigens arising from genetic mutations and establish anti-tumor activity. Immunotherapy harnessing neoantigen-specific T cells to target tumors has emerged as a promising clinical approach. To assess whether a comprehensive peripheral mononuclear blood cell analysis predicts responses to a personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine combined with anti-PD-1 therapy, we characterize the TCR repertoires and T and B cell frequencies in 21 patients with metastatic melanoma who received this regimen. TCR-α/β-chain sequencing reveals that prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) is strongly associated with increased clonal baseline TCR repertoires and longitudinal repertoire stability. Furthermore, the frequencies of antigen-experienced T and B cells in the peripheral blood correlate with repertoire characteristics. Analysis of these baseline immune features enables prediction of PFS following treatment. This method offers a pragmatic clinical approach to assess patients’ immune state and to direct therapeutic decision making. © 2020 The Author(s); Poran et al. study peripheral blood cells from metastatic melanoma patients before, during, and after treatment with personalized neoantigen therapy plus anti-PD-1. The combination of T cell receptor repertoire profiling and immunophenotyping of blood cells collected pre-treatment presents a strong predictor for response to treatment in a minimally invasive manner. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Cancer vaccines using synthetic long peptides (SLP) targeting tumor antigens have been tested in the clinic but the outcomes have been unimpressive, perhaps because these peptides elicit predominantly CD4+ T cell responses. We hypothesized that enhanced delivery of peptide antigens to, and uptake in, secondary lymphoid tissues should elicit more robust CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses and improved anti-tumor responses. Here, we have designed SLP-containing cationic lipoplexes (SLP–Lpx) that improve delivery of peptides to myeloid cells in the spleen and lymphatics. Using the G12D KRAS mutations as neoantigens, we found that vaccination of mice with naked synthetic peptides harboring the G12D mutation with CpG adjuvant stimulated mainly CD4+ T cell responses with limited tumor growth inhibition. On the other hand, immunization with SLP–Lpx stimulated both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and suppressed tumor growth in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner. Combination of the SLP–Lpx vaccines with a checkpoint inhibitor led to profound growth suppression of established tumors. These studies suggest that preferential targeting of peptides derived from neoantigens to the spleen via lipoplexes elicits potent CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses that inhibit tumor growth. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Deficiencies in DNA repair pathways, including mismatch repair (MMR), have been linked to higher tumor mutation burden and improved response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, the significance of MMR mutations in lung cancer has not been well characterized, and the relevance of other processes, including homologous recombination (HR) and polymerase epsilon (POLE) activity, remains unclear. Here, we analyzed a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Variants in DNA repair genes were associated with increased tumor mutation and neoantigen burden, which in turn were linked with greater tumor infiltration by activated T cells. The subset of tumors with DNA repair gene variants but without T cell infiltration exhibited upregulation of TGF-β and Wnt pathway genes, and a combined score incorporating these genes and DNA repair status accurately predicted immune cell infiltration. Finally, high neoantigen burden was positively associated with genes related to cytolytic activity and immune checkpoints. These findings provide evidence that DNA repair pathway defects and immunomodulatory genes together lead to specific immunophenotypes in lung squamous cell carcinoma and could potentially serve as biomarkers for immunotherapy. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Genetic mutations lead to the production of mutated proteins from which peptides are presented to T cells as cancer neoantigens. Evidence suggests that T cells that target neoantigens are the main mediators of effective cancer immunotherapies. Although algorithms have been used to predict neoantigens, only a minority are immunogenic. The factors that influence neoantigen immunogenicity are not completely understood. Here, we classified human neoantigen/neopeptide data into three categories based on their TCR-pMHC binding events. We observed a conservative mutant orientation of the anchor residue from immunogenic neoantigens which we termed the “NP” rule. By integrating this rule with an existing prediction algorithm, we found improved performance in neoantigen prioritization. To better understand this rule, we solved several neoantigen/MHC structures. These structures showed that neoantigens that follow this rule not only increase peptide-MHC binding affinity but also create new TCR-binding features. These molecular insights highlight the value of immune-based classification in neoantigen studies and may enable the design of more effective cancer immunotherapies. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Lymph node metastasis is of major prognostic significance for breast cancer. Lymph node metastasis arises at a very early stage in some patients. Using the data downloaded from the TCGA database, we studied the differences between primary tumors with and without lymph node metastasis at the multi-omics level using bioinformatics approaches. Our study found that low mutation and neoantigen burdens correlated with lymph node metastazation of breast cancer. All three conserved domains in TP53 were mutated in lymph node-negative breast cancers, whereas only one domain was mutated in lymph node-positive samples. Mutations in microtubule-related proteins appear to help immune cells recognize tumors and inhibit their lymph node metastasis. Destroying microtubule-related proteins is a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. As the neoantigens specifically present in lymph node-positive breast cancers, MAPK10, BC9L, TRIM65, CD93, KITLG, CNPPD1, CPED1, CCDC146, TMEM185A, INO80D, and PSMD11 are potential targets for vaccine design. In the tumor microenvironment, reduced numbers of effector immune cells, especially activated memory CD4+ T cells and activated mast cells, facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes. According to transcriptome data, lymph node metastasis was mostly driven by gene mutation rather than by gene expression. Although differential gene expression analysis was based on lymph node metastasis status, many genes were shown to be differentially expressed based on estrogen receptor status. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: Because of their high tumor specificity and immunogenicity, neoantigens have been considered as ultimate targets for cancer immunotherapy. Neoantigen-based vaccines have demonstrated promising efficacy for several cancer types. To further investigate the antitumor potentials for other types of solid tumors, we designed a peptide-based neoantigen vaccine, iNeo-Vac-P01, and conducted a single-arm, open-labeled, investigator-initiated clinical trial (NCT03662815). Patients and Methods: Personalized neoantigen vaccines were designed and manufactured according to our bioinformatics analysis results from the whole-exome sequencing of tumor and peripheral blood cell DNAs. Patients were scheduled to be vaccinated subcutaneously with adjuvant on days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 22 (prime phase), and days 78 and 162 (boost phase). Additional immunizations were administrated every 2-3 months as per patient's potential benefit. The safety and efficacy were assessed through adverse events (AE), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and other parameters. Results: Of the 22 patients enrolled with advanced malignancies, 20 had no or mild AEs, while 2 had grade 3 or 4 acute allergic reactions only after their sixth boost vaccination. The disease control rate was 71.4%. The median PFS was 4.6 months, whereas the median OS was not reached (12-month OS ¼ 55.1%). Around 80% of individual peptides or peptide pools elicited measurable specific immune response. In addition, our findings revealed several potential biomarkers for the prediction of better response. Conclusions: iNeo-Vac-P01 as monotherapy is feasible and safe for patients with advanced solid tumors. It could elicit T-cell-mediated immune response targeting tumor neoantigens, and might have promising antitumor efficacy. © 2020 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Purpose: DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is a hallmark of Lynch syndrome, the most common inherited cancer syndrome. MMR-deficient cancer cells accumulate numerous insertion/deletion mutations at microsatellites. Mutations of coding microsatellites (cMS) lead to the generation of immunogenic frameshift peptide (FSP) neoantigens. As the evolution of MMR-deficient cancers is triggered by mutations inactivating defined cMS-containing tumor suppressor genes, distinct FSP neoantigens are shared by most MMR-deficient cancers. To evaluate safety and immunogenicity of an FSP-based vaccine, we performed a clinical phase I/IIa trial (Micoryx). Patients and Methods: The trial comprised three cycles of four subcutaneous vaccinations (FSP neoantigens derived from mutant AIM2, HT001, TAF1B genes) mixed with Montanide ISA-51 VG over 6 months. Inclusion criteria were history of MMR-deficient colorectal cancer (UICC stage III or IV) and completion of chemotherapy. Phase I evaluated safety and toxicity as primary endpoint (six patients), phase IIa addressed cellular and humoral immune responses (16 patients). Results: Vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses were observed in all patients vaccinated per protocol. Three patients developed grade 2 local injection site reactions. No vaccination-induced severe adverse events occurred. One heavily pretreated patient with bulky metastases showed stable disease and stable CEA levels over 7 months. Conclusions: FSP neoantigen vaccination is systemically well tolerated and consistently induces humoral and cellular immune responses, thus representing a promising novel approach for treatment and even prevention of MMR-deficient cancer. © 2020 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Neoantigens present unique and specific targets for personalized cancer immunotherapy strategies. Given the low mutational burden yet immunotherapy responsiveness of malignant mesothelioma (MM) when compared to other carcinogen-induced malignancies, identifying candidate neoantigens and T cells that recognize them has been a challenge. We used pleural effusions to gain access to MM tumor cells as well as immune cells in order to characterize the tumor-immune interface in MM. We characterized the landscape of potential neoantigens from SNVs identified in 27 MM patients and performed whole transcriptome sequencing of cell populations from 18 patient-matched pleural effusions. IFNγ ELISpot was performed to detect a CD8+ T cell responses to predicted neoantigens in one patient. We detected a median of 68 (range 7–258) predicted neoantigens across the samples. Wild-type non-binding to mutant binding predicted neoantigens increased risk of death in a model adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, histology and treatment (HR: 33.22, CI: 2.55–433.02, p =.007). Gene expression analysis indicated a dynamic immune environment within the pleural effusions. TCR clonotypes increased with predicted neoantigen burden. A strong activated CD8+ T-cell response was identified for a predicted neoantigen produced by a spontaneous mutation in the ROBO3 gene. Despite the challenges associated with the identification of bonafide neoantigens, there is growing evidence that these molecular changes can provide an actionable target for personalized therapeutics in difficult to treat cancers. Our findings support the existence of candidate neoantigens in MM despite the low mutation burden of the tumor, and may present improved treatment opportunities for patients. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {To date, many clinical trials have been carried out with neoantigen-specific mRNA vaccines, and positive results have been achieved. However, further improvements in the efficiency of the intracellular delivery of mRNA and the production of a stronger immune response are still worth studying. In this study, we used the cholesterol-modified cationic peptide DP7 (VQWRIRVAVIRK), which was developed in our previous study, with a transmembrane structure and immunoadjuvant function to modify DOTAP liposomes to create a common mRNA delivery system. This system was intended to improve the efficiency of the delivery of mRNA encoding individualized neoantigens to dendritic cells (DCs) and enhance the activation of DCs. The system serves dual functions as a carrier and as an immunoadjuvant. As a carrier of mRNA, DP7-C-modified DOTAP liposomes (DOTAP/DP7-C) could transfer mRNA efficiently into different type of DCs in vitro. As an immunoadjuvant, DOTAP/DP7-C liposomes were shown to be more efficacious in stimulating DC maturation, CD103+ DC (contributing to antigen presentation) production and proinflammatory cytokine secretion than DOTAP liposomes both in vitro and in vivo. In animal studies, the subcutaneous administration of DOTAP/DP7-C/LL2 neoantigen-encoding mRNA complexes significantly inhibited the growth of LL2 in situ and the growth of subcutaneous tumors and stimulated the production of antigen-specific lymphocyte reactions, which were superior to the DOTAP/LL2 neoantigen-encoding mRNA complex group. In conclusion, DOTAP/DP7-C liposomes may serve as a potential universal mRNA delivery system, providing a simple method to increase the efficiency of intracellular mRNA delivery and the immunostimulatory activity of DCs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Personal neoantigen-based cancer vaccines are designed to target antigens arising from tumor-specific mutations within individual cancers and present a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on their favorable and intrinsic properties of escape from central tolerance and exquisite tumor specificity. With the endpoint of creating an optimal T-cell army to attack a tumor, neoantigen-based vaccines have demonstrated the ability to coax naïve T-cell recruits against epitopes that do not induce spontaneous immunity to raise long-lasting T-cell responses against multiple tumor-specific epitopes and subsequently to extend the breadth of responses, as immunity begets immunity via epitope spreading. Importantly, on both preclinical and clinical fronts, the association of T-cell responses to neoantigens and favorable outcomes has been demonstrated time and time again. We recognize, however, that the path forward remains long and winding and requires the field to address several key challenges, particularly overcoming evolved tumor escape mechanisms and optimizing vaccine-induced immunity. Some challenges stem from gaps in science that enable in silico prediction of antigen presentation and recognition by T-cell receptors, whereas others stem from the logistical obstacles and cost of personalization. Nevertheless, with perseverance and innovative solutions, we have little doubt that the ability of neoantigen vaccination to induce potent cancer-specific T cells will fundamentally succeed in enabling greater effectiveness of a broad array of immunotherapies. We provide our perspective on the progress and the remaining challenges to realizing the opportunity of personal neoantigen cancer vaccines. © 2020 American Association for Cancer Research Inc..

	abstract = {Background: Neoantigen-based personal vaccines and adoptive T cell immunotherapy have shown high efficacy as a cancer treatment in clinical trials. Algorithms for the accurate prediction of neoantigens have played a pivotal role in such studies. Some existing bioinformatics methods, such as MHCflurry and NetMHCpan, identify neoantigens mainly through the prediction of peptide-MHC binding affinity. However, the predictive accuracy of immunogenicity of these methods has been shown to be low. Thus, a ranking algorithm to select highly immunogenic neoantigens of patients is needed urgently in research and clinical practice. Results: We develop TruNeo, an integrated computational pipeline to identify and select highly immunogenic neoantigens based on multiple biological processes. The performance of TruNeo and other algorithms were compared based on data from published literature as well as raw data from a lung cancer patient. Recall rate of immunogenic ones among the top 10-ranked neoantigens were compared based on the published combined data set. Recall rate of TruNeo was 52.63%, which was 2.5 times higher than that predicted by MHCflurry (21.05%), and 2 times higher than NetMHCpan 4 (26.32%). Furthermore, the positive rate of top 10-ranked neoantigens for the lung cancer patient were compared, showing a 50% positive rate identified by TruNeo, which was 2.5 times higher than that predicted by MHCflurry (20%).

	abstract = {Objective: This study aims to screen the optional epitope peptides of HLA-A*02 restricted human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon20 insertion mutations in order to provide a novel immunotherapeutic strategy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: HLA-A*02 restricted epitopes derived from EGFR exon20 insertion mutation were predicted by IEDB, NetMHC4.0 and SYFPEITHI. The cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope-concentrated area was analyzed, and the appropriate length of polypeptides were filtered. Both cell experiments and mice models were implemented to verify the immunogenicity and antitumor efficiency of the candidate polypeptides. Results: V769_D770insASV (19.35%) mutation is a high-frequency EGFR exon20 insertion in NSCLC, which encoded YVMASVASV polypeptide with higher MHC class I binding score than other insertions. E-ASV-10 and E-ASV-19, both possessing the core sequence of YVMASVASV polypeptide, were capable to induce the expansion and activation of HLA-A*02 restricted T cells in vitro, displaying increase in the proportion of 4-1BB+CD25+ population and the production and release of IFN-γ in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. E-ASV-10 stimulated the amplification of cytotoxic T cells against the LLC cells carrying th eEGFR exon20 V769_D770insASVmutation(LLCasv) in C57BL/6 mice. Conclusions: E-ASV-10 and E-ASV-19 could induce the expansion and activation of human HLA-A* 02 restricted T cells in vitro, and stimulate specific cytotoxic CTL response against LLCasv in C57BL/6 mice, which might become an promosing immunotherapeutic approach for NSCLC patients carrying EGFR exon20 V769_D770insASV mutation. © 2020 China Anti-Cancer Association.

	abstract = {Background: It is widely hoped that personal cancer vaccines will extend the number of patients benefiting from checkpoint and other immunotherapies. However, it is clear creating such vaccines will be challenging. It requires obtaining and sequencing tumor DNA/RNA, predicting potentially immunogenic neoepitopes and manufacturing a one-use vaccine. This process takes time and considerable cost. Importantly, most mutations will not produce an immunogenic peptide and many patient's tumors do not contain enough DNA mutations to make a vaccine. We have discovered that frameshift peptides (FSP) created from errors in the production of RNA rather than from DNA mutations are potentially a rich source of neoantigens for cancer vaccines. These errors are predictable, enabling the production of a FSP microarray. Previously we found that these microarrays can identify both personal and shared neoantigens. Here, we compared the performance of personal cancer vaccines (PCVs) with that of a shared antigen vaccine, termed Frameshift Antigen Shared Therapeutic (FAST) vaccine, using the 4 T1 breast cancer model. Sera from 4 T1-tumor bearing mice were assayed on the peptide microarray containing 200 Fs neoantigens, for the PCV, the top 10 candidates were select and personal vaccines constructed and administrated to the respective mice. For the FAST, we selected the top 10 candidates with higher prevalence among all the mice challenged. Seven to 12 days challenged mice were immunized, combined or not with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) (αPD-L1 and αCTLA-4). Primary and secondary tumor clearance and growth were evaluated as well as cellular and humoral immune response against the vaccine targets by IFN-γELISPOT and ELISA. Lastly, we analyzed the immune response of the FAST-vaccinated mice by flow cytometry in comparison to the control group. Results: We found that PCVs and FAST vaccines both reduced primary tumor incidence and growth as well as lung metastases when delivered as monotherapies or in combination with ICI. Additionally, the FAST vaccine induces a robust and effective T-cell response. Conclusions: These results suggest that FSPs produced from RNA-based errors are potent neoantigens that could enable production of off-the-shelf shared antigen vaccines for solid tumors with efficacy comparable to that of PCVs. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Mutations in CTNNB1, the gene encoding β-catenin, are common in colon and liver cancers, the most frequent mutation affecting Ser-45 in β-catenin. Peptides derived from WT β-catenin have previously been shown to be presented on the cell surface as part of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, suggesting an opportunity for targeting this common driver gene mutation with antibody-based therapies. Here, crystal structures of both the WT and S45F mutant peptide bound to HLA-A*03:01 at 2.20 and 2.45 Å resolutions, respectively, confirmed the accessibility of the phenylalanine residue for antibody recognition. Phage display was then used to identify single-chain variable fragment clones that selectively bind the S45F mutant peptide presented in HLA-A*03:01 and have minimal WT or other off-target binding. Following the initial characterization of five clones, we selected a single clone, E10, for further investigation. We developed a computational model of the binding of E10 to the mutant peptide- bound HLA-A3, incorporating data from affinity maturation as initial validation. In the future, our model may be used to design clones with maintained specificity and higher affinity. Such derivatives could be adapted into either cell-based (CAR-T) or protein-based (bispecific T-cell engagers) therapies to target cancer cells harboring the S45F mutation in CTNNB1. © 2019 American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Inc..

	abstract = {Cancer vaccines can generate and amplify tumor-specific T cell responses with the promise to provide long-term control of cancer. All cancer cells harbor genetic alterations encoding neoantigens that are specific to the tumor and not present in normal tissue. Similar to foreign antigens targeted by T cells in infectious disease settings, neoantigens represent the long elusive immunogens for cancer vaccination. Since the vast majority of mutations are unique to individual tumors, neoantigen vaccines require custom design for each patient. The availability of rapid and cost-effective genome sequencing, along with advanced bioinformatics tools, now allows neoantigen-target discovery and vaccine manufacturing in sufficient time for the treatment of cancer patients. Clinical trials in melanoma and glioblastoma have demonstrated the feasibility, immunogenicity, and signals of efficacy of this personalized immunotherapy approach. Key unresolved areas include identification of the most effective vaccine delivery platforms, validation and consensus of neoantigen target selection, and optimal strategies for partnering immunotherapies. Given the universal presence of mutations in cancer and the patient-tailored paradigm, personalized neoantigen vaccines have potential applicability for all cancer patients. © 2020 Annual Reviews Inc..

	abstract = {Personalized cancer vaccines are a promising approach for inducing T cell immunity to tumor neoantigens. Using a self-assembling nanoparticle vaccine that links neoantigen peptides to a Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist (SNP-7/8a), we show how the route and dose alter the magnitude and quality of neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Intravenous vaccination (SNP-IV) induced a higher proportion of TCF1+PD-1+CD8+ T cells as compared to subcutaneous immunization (SNP-SC). Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that SNP-IV induced stem-like genes (Tcf7, Slamf6, Xcl1) whereas SNP-SC enriched for effector genes (Gzmb, Klrg1, Cx3cr1). Stem-like cells generated by SNP-IV proliferated and differentiated into effector cells upon checkpoint blockade, leading to superior antitumor response as compared to SNP-SC in a therapeutic model. The duration of antigen presentation by dendritic cells controlled the magnitude and quality of CD8+ T cells. These data demonstrate how to optimize antitumor immunity by modulating vaccine parameters for specific generation of effector or stem-like CD8+ T cells. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.},

	abstract = {Immunotherapies that harness the immune system to kill cancer cells have showed significant therapeutic efficacy in many human malignancies. A growing number of studies have highlighted the relevance of neoantigens in recognizing cancer cells by intrinsic T cells. Cancer neoantigens are a direct consequence of somatic mutations presenting on the surface of individual cancer cells. Neoantigens are fully cancer-specific and exempt from central tolerance. In addition, neoantigens are important targets for checkpoint blockade therapy. Recently, technological innovations have made neoantigen discovery possible in a variety of malignancies, thus providing an impetus to develop novel immunotherapies that selectively enhance T cell reactivity for the destruction of cancer cells while leaving normal tissues unharmed. In this review, we aim to introduce the methods of the identification of neoantigens, the mutational patterns of human cancers, related clinical trials, neoantigen burden and sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. Moreover, we focus on relevant challenges of targeting neoantigens for cancer treatment. © Copyright © 2020 Han, Ma, Yang, Wei, Peng and Wei.},

Recently, neoantigens derived from nonsynonymous mutations in tumor cells have emerged as alternatives that can improve tumor-specificity and reduce on-target off-tumor toxicity. Synthetic peptides are a common platform for neoantigen vaccines. It has been suggested that extending short peptides into long peptides can overcome immune tolerance and induce both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses.

	abstract = {Development of personalized cancer vaccines based on neoantigens has become a new direction in cancer immunotherapy. Two forms of cancer vaccines have been widely studied: tumor-associated antigen (including proteins, peptides, or tumor lysates)-pulsed dendritic cell (DC) vaccines and protein- or peptide-adjuvant vaccines. However, different immune modalities may produce different therapeutic effects and immune responses when the same antigen is used. Therefore, it is necessary to choose a more effective neoantigen vaccination method. In this study, we compared the differences in immune and anti-tumor effects between neoantigen-pulsed DC vaccines and neoantigen-adjuvant vaccines using murine lung carcinoma (LL2) candidate neoantigens. The enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay showed that 4/6 of the neoantigen-adjuvant vaccines and 6/6 of the neoantigen-pulsed DC vaccines induced strong T-cell immune responses. Also, 2/6 of the neoantigen-adjuvant vaccines and 5/6 of the neoantigen-pulsed DC vaccines exhibited potent anti-tumor effects. The results indicated that the neoantigen-pulsed DC vaccines were superior to the neoantigen-adjuvant vaccines in both activating immune responses and inhibiting tumor growth. Our fundings provide an experimental basis for the selection of immune modalities for the use of neoantigens in individualized tumor immunotherapies. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Neoantigen vaccines have been enthusiastically pursued for personalized cancer immunotherapy while vast majority of neoantigens have no or low immunogenicity. Here, a bi-adjuvant neoantigen nanovaccine (banNV) that codelivered a peptide neoantigen (Adpgk) with two adjuvants [Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist R848 and TLR9 agonist CpG] was developed for potent cancer immunotherapy. Specifically, banNVs were prepared by a nano-templated synthesis of concatemer CpG, nanocondensation with cationic polypeptides, and then physical loading with hydrophobic R848 and Adpgk. The immunogenicity of the neoantigen was profoundly potentiated by efficient codelivery of neoantigen and dual synergistic adjuvants, which is accompanied by reduced acute systemic toxicity. BanNVs sensitized immune checkpoint programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) on T cells, therefore, a combination of banNVs with aPD-1 conspicuously induced the therapy response and led to complete regression of 70% neoantigen-specific tumors without recurrence. We conclude that banNVs are promising to optimize personalized therapeutic neoantigen vaccines for cancer immunotherapy.

	abstract = {Background There is increasing evidence for the benefit of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in a subset of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) patients, especially those with homologous recombination (HR)-deficient tumors. However, new treatment strategies, such as immune checkpoint inhibition, are required for patients with HR-proficient tumors. Methods A total of 80 cases of HGSC were analyzed in this study. Whole exome and RNA sequencing was performed for these tumors. Methylation arrays were also carried out to examine BRCA1 and RAD51C promoter methylation status. Mutations, neoantigen load, antigen presentation machinery, and local immune profile were investigated, and the relationships of these factors with clinical outcome were also analyzed. Results As expected, the numbers of predicted neoAgs were lower in HR-proficient (n=46) than HR-deficient tumors (n=34). However, 40% of the patients with HR-proficient tumors still had higher than median numbers of neoAgs and better survival than patients with lower numbers of neoAgs. Incorporation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-class I expression status into the survival analysis revealed that patients with both high neoAg numbers and high HLA-class I expression (neoAg hi HLA hi) had the best progression-free survival (PFS) in HR-proficient HGSC (p=0.0087). Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that the genes for effector memory CD8 T cells, TH1 T cells, the interferon-γresponse, and other immune-related genes, were enriched in these patients. Interestingly, this subset of patients also had better PFS (p=0.0015) and a more T-cell-inflamed tumor phenotype than patients with the same phenotype (neoAg hi HLA hi) in HR-deficient HGSC. Conclusions Our results suggest that immune checkpoint inhibitors might be an alternative to explore in HR-proficient cases which currently do not benefit from PARP inhibition. © © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) has recently been shown to be predictive of checkpoint blockade response in melanomas and sarcomas, and are prognostic for survival in PDAC. In order to more comprehensively understand tumor immunity in PDAC patients with TLS, we performed RNA-seq, single and multiplex IHC, flow cytometry and predictive genomic analysis on treatment naïve, PDAC surgical specimens. Forty-six percent of tumors contained distinct T and B cell aggregates reflective of “early-stage TLS” (ES-TLS), which correlated with longer overall and progression-free survival. These tumors had greater CD8+ T cell infiltration but were not defined by previously published TLS gene-expression signatures. ES-TLS+ tumors were enriched for IgG1 class-switched memory B cells and memory CD4+ T cells, suggesting durable immunological memory persisted in these patients. We also observed the presence of active germinal centers (mature-TLS) in 31% of tumors with lymphocyte clusters, whose patients had long-term survival (median 56 months). M-TLS-positive tumors had equivalent overall T cell infiltration to ES-TLS, but were enriched for activated CD4+ memory cells, naive B cells and NK cells. Finally, using a TCGA-PDAC dataset, ES-TLS+ tumors harbored a decreased TMB, but M-TLS with germinal centers expressed significantly more MHCI-restricted neoantigens as determined by an in silico neoantigen prediction method. Interestingly, M-TLS+ tumors also had evidence of increased rates of B cell somatic hypermutation, suggesting that germinal centers form in the presence of high-quality tumor neoantigens leading to increased humoral immunity that confers improved survival for PDAC patients.

	abstract = {Immunotherapy has shown limited success in prostate cancer; this may be partially explained by its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), the most common treatment for prostate cancer, initially promotes a robust T cell infiltrate, T cell responses are later attenuated. Based on the castration-sensitive Myc-CaP model, we developed an antigen-specific system to study CD8 T cell tolerance to prostate tumors. This model is unique in that CD8 T cells recognize a bona-fide tumor antigen (Her-2/neu), rather than an overexpressed xenogenic antigen like chicken ovalbumin or influenza hemagglutinin. Using this novel model, we demonstrate robust tolerance that is not alleviated by TLR agonists or ADT. This model may serve as a novel and useful tool to further interrogate methods by which to augment anti-tumor cancer immune responses to prostate cancer. Significance: Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in men worldwide, with an estimated 33,000 deaths projected in the U.S. in 2020. Although primary (localized) tumors can be cured by surgery or radiation, approximately 40% of patients eventually develop recurrent disease. While initially responsive to androgen-deprivation, many patients with recurrent prostate cancer eventually progress to a more advanced disease state known as metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC); this is the lethal phenotype. These studies describe a novel androgen-responsive murine cell line that expresses a bona-fide tumor antigen (Her-2/neu). Pre-clinical work with this model shows robust and antigen-specific CD8 T cell tolerance, providing a novel preclinical model to study CD8 T cell tolerance to prostate tumors. © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Tumors with high mutational burden (TMB) tend to be responsive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) because there are neoantigens available for targeting by reinvigorated T cells, whereas those with low TMB demonstrate limited clinical responses. To determine whether antigen-specific T cell responses can be elicited after treatment with ICB in cancers that have a low TMB, we conducted a clinical trial with ipilimumab in 30 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We identified two distinct cohorts by survival and progression times: “favorable” (n = 9) and “unfavorable” (n = 10). Patients in the favorable cohort had high intratumoral CD8 T cell density and IFN-γ response gene signature and/or antigen-specific T cell responses. Two patients with a relatively low TMB had T cell responses against unique neoantigens. Moreover, six of nine patients in the favorable group are still alive at the time of analysis, with survival ranging from 33 to 54 months after treatment. All 10 patients in the unfavorable cohort have succumbed to their disease and had survival ranging from 0.6 to 10.3 months. Collectively, our data indicate that immunological correlates associated with effector T cell responses are observed in patients with metastatic prostate cancer who benefit from ICB.

	abstract = {Tumors acquire numerous mutations during development and progression. When translated into proteins, these mutations give rise to neoantigens that can be recognized by T cells and generate antibodies, representing an exciting direction of cancer immunotherapy. While neoantigens have been reported in many cancer types, the profiling of neoantigens often focused on the class-I subtype that are presented to CD8 + T cells, and the relationship between neoantigen load and clinical outcomes was often inconsistent among cancer types. In this study, we described an informatics workflow, REAL-neo, for identification, quality control (QC), and prioritization of both class-I and class-II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) bound neoantigens that arise from somatic single nucleotide mutations (SNM), small insertions and deletions (INDEL), and gene fusions. We applied REAL-neo to 835 primary breast tumors in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and performed comprehensive profiling and characterization of the detected neoantigens. We found recurrent HLA class-I and class-II restricted neoantigens across breast cancer cases, and uncovered associations between neoantigen load and clinical traits. Both class-I and class-II neoantigen loads from SNM and INDEL were found to predict overall survival independent of tumor mutational burden (TMB), breast cancer subtypes, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) levels, tumor stage, and age at diagnosis. Our study highlighted the importance of accurate and comprehensive neoantigen profiling and QC, and is the first to report the predictive value of neoantigen load for overall survival in breast cancer. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: Neoantigens can be differentially recognized by T cell receptor (TCR) as these sequences are derived from mutant proteins and are unique to the tumor. The discovery of neoantigens is the first key step for tumor-specific antigen (TSA) based immunotherapy. Based on high-throughput tumor genomic analysis, each missense mutation can potentially give rise to multiple neopeptides, resulting in a vast total number, but only a small percentage of these peptides may achieve immune-dominant status with a given major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I allele. Specific identification of immunogenic candidate neoantigens is consequently a major challenge. Currently almost all neoantigen prediction tools are based on genomics data. Results: Here we report the construction of proteogenomics prediction of neoantigen (ProGeo-neo) pipeline, which incorporates the following modules: mining tumor specific antigens from next-generation sequencing genomic and mRNA expression data, predicting the binding mutant peptides to class I MHC molecules by latest netMHCpan (v.4.0), verifying MHC-peptides by MaxQuant with mass spectrometry proteomics data searched against customized protein database, and checking potential immunogenicity of T-cell-recognization by additional screening methods. ProGeo-neo pipeline achieves proteogenomics strategy and the neopeptides identified were of much higher quality as compared to those identified using genomic data only. Conclusions: The pipeline was constructed based on the genomics and proteomics data of Jurkat leukemia cell line but is generally applicable to other solid cancer research.

	abstract = {Cancer genome instability leads to accumulation of mutations which may result into tumor-specific mutated “neoantigens”, not be affected by central T-cell tolerance. Such neoantigens are considered the optimal target for the patient’s anti-tumor T cell immunity as well as for personalized cancer immunotherapy strategies. However, only a minor fraction of predicted neoantigens are relevant to the clinical outcome. In the present study, a prediction algorithm was applied using datasets of RNA sequencing from all 377 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients available at The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), to predict neoantigens to be presented by each patient's autologous HLA molecules. Correlation with patients’ survival was performed on the 115 samples for whom the exact date of death was known. A total of 30 samples were used for the training set, and 85 samples were used for the validation sets. Neither the somatic mutations nor the number nor the quality of the predicted neoantigens correlate as single parameter with survival of HCC patients who do not undergo immunotherapy treatment. Furthermore, the preferential presentation of such neoantigens in the context of one of the major histocompatibility complex MHC class I molecules does not have an impact on the survival. On the contrary, the expression of Granzyme A (GZMA) is significantly correlated with survival and, in the context of high GZMA, a direct correlation between number and quality of neoantigens with survival is observed. This is in striking contrast to results described in cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy, in which a strong correlation between Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB), number of predicted neoantigens and survival has been reported. © MDPI AG.

Next generation T cell products, selectively expanded against clonal neoantigens, have the potential to induce deep durable remissions in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, a tumour with one of the highest clonal neoantigen burdens of all cancer. © 2019 Achilles Therapeutics Limited; Immune checkpoint blockade has significantly improved clinical outcomes for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other solid tumours, but many patients do not respond and acquired resistance is common. Aspects of the tumour microenvironment linked to clinical outcomes include the proportion of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), tumour programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) score and tumour mutation burden. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), a technique that works by infusing ex vivo expanded T lymphocytes to increase the effector cell pool in tumours, is anticipated to become a viable therapeutic option for patients with solid tumours, akin to chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy in haematological malignancies. TIL therapy has shown durable clinical responses in heavily pre-treated patients with melanoma and other solid tumours. We review the experience of ACT with TILs and the recent evidence that clonal neoantigens might be the most relevant immunotherapeutic targets in heterogeneous solid tumours such as NSCLC. Clonal (or truncal) neoantigens arise from the earliest mutagenic events in tumour evolution, and are retained over time in all tumour cells within a patient, making them the ideal target for T cell therapy. NSCLC has one of the highest clonal mutation burdens of all cancers through exposure to carcinogens in tobacco smoke, providing a strong rationale to develop clonal neoantigen reactive T cells (cNeT) for this indication. The first treatment modality to test this concept clinically is ATL001, a cNeT product that is derived from autologous TILs and enriched for T cells specifically recognizing clonal neoantigenic epitopes by selective expansion. Clinical studies of ATL001 will commence in 2019. © 2019 Achilles Therapeutics Limited},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is resistant to multimodality therapeutic approaches. A high burden of tumor-specific mutant peptides (neoantigens) correlates with better survival and response to immunotherapies in selected solid tumors but how neoantigens impact clinical outcome in GBM remains unclear. Here, we exploit the similarity between tumor neoantigens and infectious disease-derived immune epitopes and apply a neoantigen fitness model for identifying high-quality neoantigens in a human pan-glioma dataset. We find that the neoantigen quality fitness model stratifies GBM patients with more favorable clinical outcome and, together with CD8+ T lymphocytes tumor infiltration, identifies a GBM subgroup with the longest survival, which displays distinct genomic and transcriptomic features. Conversely, neither tumor neoantigen burden from a quantitative model nor the isolated enrichment of CD8+ T lymphocytes were able to predict survival of GBM patients. This approach may guide optimal stratification of GBM patients for maximum response to immunotherapy. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) harbors somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain variable region genes, IGHV and IGK/LV. Recent studies have revealed that IGV SHM creates neoantigens that activate T-cell responses against B-cell lymphoma. Methods: To determine the clinical relevance of IGV SHM in DLBCL treated with standard immunochemotherapy, we performed next-generation sequencing of the immunoglobulin variable regions and complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) for 378 patients with de novo DLBCL. The prognostic effects of IGV SHM and ongoing SHM or intra-clonal heterogeneity were analyzed in the training (192 patients), validation (186 patients), and overall DLBCL cohorts. To gain mechanistic insight, we analyzed the predicted IG-derived neoantigens' immunogenicity potential, determined by the major histocompatibility complex-binding affinity and the frequency-of-occurrence of T cell-exposed motifs (TCEMs) in a TCEM repertoire derived from human proteome, microbiome, and pathogen databases. Furthermore, IGV SHM was correlated with molecular characteristics of DLBCL and PD-1/L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment assessed by fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry. Results: SHM was commonly found in IGHV and less frequently in IGK/LV. High levels of clonal IGHV SHM (SHMhigh) were associated with prolonged overall survival in DLBCL patients, particularly those without BCL2 or MYC translocation. In contrast, long heavy chain CDR3 length, the presence of IGHV ongoing SHM in DLBCL, and high clonal IGK/LV SHM in germinal center B-cell-like (GCB)-DLBCL were associated with poor prognosis. These prognostic effects were significant in both the training and validation sets. By prediction, the SHMhigh groups harbored more potentially immune-stimulatory neoantigens with high binding affinity and rare TCEMs. PD-1/L1 expression in CD8+ T cells was significantly lower in IGHV SHMhigh than in SHMlow patients with activated B-cell-like DLBCL, whereas PD-1 expression in CD4+ T cells and PD-L1 expression in natural killer cells were higher in IGK/LV SHMhigh than in SHMlow patients with GCB-DLBCL. PD-L1/L2 (9p24.1) amplification was associated with high IGHV SHM and ongoing SHM. Conclusions: These results show for the first time that IGV SHMhigh and ongoing SHM have prognostic effects in DLBCL and potential implications for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and neoantigen-based immunotherapies. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: High-throughput sequencing technology has yielded reliable and ultra-fast sequencing for DNA and RNA. For tumor cells of cancer patients, when combining the results of DNA and RNA sequencing, one can identify potential neoantigens that stimulate the immune response of the T cell. However, when the somatic mutations are abundant, it is computationally challenging to efficiently prioritize the identified neoantigen candidates according to their ability of activating the T cell immuno-response. Methods: Numerous prioritization or prediction approaches have been proposed to address this issue but none of them considers the original DNA loci of the neoantigens from the perspective of 3D genome. Based on our previous discoveries, we propose to investigate the distribution of neoantigens with different immunogenicity abilities in 3D genome and propose to adopt this important information into neoantigen prediction. Results: We retrospect the DNA origins of the immuno-positive and immuno-negative neoantigens in the context of 3D genome and discovered that DNA loci of the immuno-positive neoantigens and immuno-negative neoantigens have very different distribution pattern. Specifically, comparing to the background 3D genome, DNA loci of the immuno-positive neoantigens tend to locate at specific regions in the 3D genome. We thus used this information into neoantigen prediction and demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach. Conclusion: We believe that the 3D genome information will help to increase the precision of neoantigen prioritization and discovery and eventually benefit precision and personalized medicine in cancer immunotherapy. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Rationale: We previously isolated antibodies binding to glycopeptide neoantigen epitopes centering the GSTA sequence of the highly glycosylated tandem repeat region of MUC1. Epitopes centering the GSTA sequence are also predicted by NetMHC programs to bind to MHC molecules. Detecting MUC1 glycopeptide epitopes remains a challenge since antigenic epitopes are often shorter than 10 amino acids. Methods: In this study, we used pronase from Streptomyces griseus, which has no amino acid sequence preference for enzymatic cleavage sites, to digest synthetic glycopeptides RPAPGST (Tn)APPAHG and RPAPGS (Tn)TAPPAHG, and analyzed the digests by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) using electron transfer dissociation (ETD) and higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) methods with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribid mass spectrometer. Results: We found that short glycopeptides containing 8 to 11 amino acids could be efficiently generated by pronase digestion. Such glycopeptides of minimal epitope lengths were clearly distinguished by characteristic MS/MS ion patterns and LC elution profiles. A glycopeptide library was generated which may serve as a standard for measuring neoantigen epitopes centering the GSTA sequence. Conclusions: Our data established the LC/MS/MS identities of a clinically relevant MUC1 glycopeptide neoantigen epitope centering the GSTA motif. A library of short MUC1 glycopeptides centered on the GSTA motif was created, which is a critical step for analysis of such antigen epitopes in real biological samples. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Although PD-L1 expression on tumor is related to the prognosis of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, a recent study also demonstrated clinical benefits even in patients without PD-L1 expression. To understand the relationship between innate resistance and antitumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses especially against neoantigens, the interaction between PD-L1+ or genetically PD-L1-deleted colorectal tumors and CTLs was assessed under an ICB therapy, finding the robust CTL activation in PD-L1-deleted tumor-bearing mice. Using antigen libraries based on immunogenomics, we identified three H2-Kb-restricted, somatic-mutated immunogenic neoantigens by utilizing enhanced CTLs responses due to PD-L1 deficiency. Furthermore, we identified three T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires relevant to the neoantigens, confirming the response of TCR-gene-transduced CTLs to parental tumor cells. Notably, neoantigen-pulsed dendritic cell (DC) therapy reversed the tumor tolerance. Thus, innate resistance of tumors determines their responsiveness to neoantigens and mixed neoantigen peptides may be useful in DC therapy against innate resistance type tumor. © 2020},

	abstract = {The combination of immune-stimulating strategies has the potency to improve immunotherapy of cancer. Vaccination against neoepitopes derived from patient tumor material can generate tumor-specific T cell immunity, which could reinforce the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor therapies such as anti-PD-1 treatment. DNA vaccination is a versatile platform that allows the inclusion of multiple neoantigen-coding sequences in a single formulation and therefore represents an ideal platform for neoantigen vaccination. We developed an anti-tumor vaccine based on a synthetic DNA vector designed to contain multiple cancer-specific epitopes in tandem. The DNA vector encoded a fusion gene consisting of three neoepitopes derived from the mouse colorectal tumor MC38 and their natural flanking sequences as 40 amino acid stretches. In addition, we incorporated as reporter epitopes the helper and CTL epitope sequences of ovalbumin. The poly-neoantigen DNA vaccine elicited T cell responses to all three neoantigens and induced functional CD8 and CD4 T cell responses to the reporter antigen ovalbumin after intradermal injection in mice. The DNA vaccine was effective in preventing outgrowth of B16 melanoma expressing ovalbumin in a prophylactic setting. Moreover, the combination of therapeutic DNA vaccination and anti-PD-1 treatment was synergistic in controlling MC38 tumor growth whereas individual treatments did not succeed. These data demonstrate the potential of DNA vaccination to target multiple neoepitopes in a single formulation and highlight the cooperation between vaccine-based and checkpoint blockade immunotherapies for the successful eradication of established tumors. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Following the advent of cancer immunotherapy, increasing insight has been gained on the role of mutational load and neoantigens as key ingredients in T cell recognition of malignancies. However, not all highly mutational tumours react to immune therapies, and initial success is often followed by eventual relapse. Heterogeneity in the neoantigen landscape of a tumour might be key in the failure of immune surveillance. In this work, we present a mathematical framework to describe how neoantigen distributions shape the immune response. The model predicts the existence of an antigen diversity threshold level beyond which T cells fail at controlling heterogeneous tumours. Incorporating this diversity marker adds predictive value to antigen load for two cohorts of anti-CTLA-4 treated melanoma patients. Furthermore, our analytical approach indicates rapid increases in epitope heterogeneity in early malignancy growth following immune escape. We propose a combination therapy scheme that takes advantage of preexisting resistance to a targeted agent. The model indicates that the selective sweep for a resistant subclone reduces neoantigen heterogeneity, and we postulate the existence of a time window before tumour relapse where checkpoint blockade immunotherapy can become more effective.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Motivation: The mutations of cancers can encode the seeds of their own destruction, in the form of T-cell recognizable immunogenic peptides, also known as neoantigens. It is computationally challenging, however, to accurately prioritize the potential neoantigen candidates according to their ability of activating the T-cell immunoresponse, especially when the somatic mutations are abundant. Although a few neoantigen prioritization methods have been proposed to address this issue, advanced machine learning model that is specifically designed to tackle this problem is still lacking. Moreover, none of the existing methods considers the original DNA loci of the neoantigens in the perspective of 3D genome which may provide key information for inferring neoantigens' immunogenicity. Results: In this study, we discovered that DNA loci of the immunopositive and immunonegative MHC-I neoantigens have distinct spatial distribution patterns across the genome. We therefore used the 3D genome information along with an ensemble pMHC-I coding strategy, and developed a group feature selection-based deep sparse neural network model (DNN-GFS) that is optimized for neoantigen prioritization. DNN-GFS demonstrated increased neoantigen prioritization power comparing to existing sequence-based approaches. We also developed a webserver named deepAntigen (http://yishi.sjtu.edu.cn/deepAntigen) that implements the DNN-GFS as well as other machine learning methods. We believe that this work provides a new perspective toward more accurate neoantigen prediction which eventually contribute to personalized cancer immunotherapy.

	abstract = {Background Collecting duct carcinoma (CDC) of the kidney is a rare and highly aggressive malignant tumor with the worst prognosis among all renal cancers. Nevertheless, the first-line treatments, including chemotherapy and target therapy, usually show poor response to CDC. Recent studies have suggested that immunotherapy targeting personal tumor-specific neoantigens could be a promising strategy for several solid cancers. However, whether it has therapeutic potential in CDC remains unclear. Case presentation Here, we report a case of an Asian patient who underwent personalized neoantigen-based immunotherapy. The patient was diagnosed with metastatic CDC and suffered extensive tumor progression following sorafenib treatment. Based on the patient's own somatic mutational profile, a total of 13 neoantigens were identified and corresponding long-peptide vaccine and neoantigen-reactive T cells (NRTs) were prepared. After six cycles of neoantigen-based vaccination and T-cell immunotherapy, the patient was reported with stable disease status in tumor burden and significant alleviation of bone pain. Ex vivo interferon-γenzyme-linked immunospot assay proved the reactivity to 12 of 13 neoantigens in peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected after immunotherapy, and the preferential reactivity to mutant peptides compared with corresponding wild-type peptides was also observed for 3 of the neoantigens. Surprisingly, biopsy sample collected from CDC sites after 3 months of immunotherapy showed decreased mutant allele frequency corresponding to 92% (12/13) of the neoantigens, indicating the elimination of tumor cells carrying these neoantigens. Conclusions Our case report demonstrated that the combined therapy of neoantigen peptide vaccination and NRT cell infusion showed certain efficacy in this CDC case, even when the patient carried only a relatively low tumor mutation burden. These results indicated that the personalized neoantigen-based immunotherapy was a promising new strategy for advanced CDC.

	abstract = {Treatment of metastatic melanoma with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is currently applied in several centers. Robust and remarkably consistent overall response rates, of around 50% of treated patients, have been observed across hospitals, including a substantial fraction of durable, complete responses. Purpose Execute a phase I/II feasibility study with TIL therapy in metastatic melanoma at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, with the goal to assess feasibility and potential value of a randomized phase III trial. Experimental Ten patients were treated with TIL therapy. Infusion products and peripheral blood samples were phenotypically characterized and neoantigen reactivity was assessed. Here, we present long-term clinical outcome and translational data on neoantigen reactivity of the T cell products. Results Five out of 10 patients, who were all anti-PD-1 naïve at time of treatment, showed an objective clinical response, including two patients with a complete response that are both ongoing for more than 7 years. Immune monitoring demonstrated that neoantigen-specific T cells were detectable in TIL infusion products from three out of three patients analyzed. For six out of the nine neoantigen-specific T cell responses detected in these TIL products, T cell response magnitude increased significantly in the peripheral blood compartment after therapy, and neoantigen-specific T cells were detectable for up to 3 years after TIL infusion. Conclusion The clinical results from this study confirm the robustness of TIL therapy in metastatic melanoma and the potential role of neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity. In addition, the data from this study supported the rationale to initiate an ongoing multicenter phase III TIL trial. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

	abstract = {Genomics-based neoantigen discovery can be enhanced by proteomic evidence, but there remains a lack of consensus on the performance of different quality control methods for variant peptide identification in proteogenomics. We propose to use the difference between accurately predicted and observed retention times for each peptide as a metric to evaluate different quality control methods. To this end, we develop AutoRT, a deep learning algorithm with high accuracy in retention time prediction. Analysis of three cancer data sets with a total of 287 tumor samples using different quality control strategies results in substantially different numbers of identified variant peptides and putative neoantigens. Our systematic evaluation, using the proposed retention time metric, provides insights and practical guidance on the selection of quality control strategies. We implement the recommended strategy in a computational workflow named NeoFlow to support proteogenomics-based neoantigen prioritization, enabling more sensitive discovery of putative neoantigens. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background. Although clinical trials testing immunotherapies in glioblastoma (GBM) have yielded mixed results, new strategies targeting tumor-specific somatic coding mutations, termed “neoantigens,” represent promising therapeutic approaches. We characterized the microenvironment and neoantigen landscape of the aggressive CT2A GBM model in order to develop a platform to test combination checkpoint blockade and neoantigen vaccination. Methods. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on intracranial CT2A and GL261 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Whole-exome DNA and RNA sequencing of the CT2A murine GBM was employed to identify expressed, somatic mutations. Predicted neoantigens were identified using the pVAC-seq software suite, and top-ranking candidates were screened for reactivity by interferon-gamma enzyme linked immunospot assays. Survival analysis was performed comparing neoantigen vaccination, anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (αPD-L1), or combination therapy. Results. Compared with the GL261 model, CT2A exhibited immunologic features consistent with human GBM including reduced αPD-L1 sensitivity and hypofunctional TILs. Of the 29 CT2A neoantigens screened, we identified neoantigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in the intracranial TIL and draining lymph nodes to two H2-Kb restricted (Epb4H471L and Pomgnt1R497L) and one H2-Db restricted neoantigen (Plin2G332R). Survival analysis showed that therapeutic neoantigen vaccination with Epb4H471L, Pomgnt1R497L, and Plin2G332R, in combination with αPD-L1 treatment was superior to αPD-L1 alone. Conclusions. We identified endogenous neoantigen specific CD8+ T cells within an αPD-L1 resistant murine GBM and show that neoantigen vaccination significantly augments survival benefit in combination with αPD-L1 treatment. These observations provide important preclinical correlates for GBM immunotherapy trials and support further investigation into the effects of multimodal immunotherapeutic interventions on antiglioma immunity. © The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {Objective: To screen candidate epitopes of breast cancer HLA-A2 restrictive neoantigen and to identify high frequency mutation sites in breast cancer neoantigen by using bioinformatics method. Methods: NCBI and GDC databases were used to search missense mutation sites formed by single nucleotide mutation in breast cancer among reported literatures and sequencing data. The new antigen epitopes were predicted by HLA-A2 antigen epitope prediction website BIMAS, SYFPEITHI and artificial neural networkbased NetMHC4.0, and the epitopes with TAP binding power less than Intermediate were eliminated. The candidate epitopes were prioritized by mutation frequency and prediction results. Results: A total of 17 high-frequency mutation genes, including BTLA, ERBB2 and NBPF12 etc, were screened by the above-mentioned methods, and a total of 26 neoantigen epitopes were identified. The binding power of epitopes predicted using BIMAS and SYFPEITHI showed great difference (P<0.05), epitopes in high priority as GSTP1 (A114V, mutation frequency of 5.94%) and BRCA2 (N991H, mutation frequency of 5.40%) etc, were expected to be candidate neo-antigen epitopes; however, their mutation frequency was relatively too low to achieve"universal use". The possibility of these epitopes used as general breast cancer neo-antigen epitopes is less likely. Conclusion: The common mutation frequency of breast cancer is lower than that of other tumors; it 's difficult to find"universal"new antigen epitopes of breast cancer; the individualized neoantigen vaccine may be of more promise, which needs further research. © 2020 Editorial office of Chinese Journal of Cancer Biotherapy.

T cell epitope in silico prediction algorithms have been widely used for neoantigen prediction; nonetheless, this platform lacks the experimental evidence of directly identification of the presented epitopes on cell surface. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is an advanced analytical technology for large-scale peptide sequencing, which has become a powerful tool for directly profiling the immunopeptidome presented by MHC molecules. Integrating with next-generation sequencing, proteogenomic analysis provides the “gold standard” for neoantigen identification at protein level. This method discovers the tumor-specific neoantigens derived from somatic mutations, proteasome splicing, noncoding RNA, and post-translational modified antigens. Herein, we review basis of antigen processing and presentation, tumor antigen classification, existing approaches for neoantigen discovery, quantitative proteomics, epitope prediction programs, and advantages and drawbacks of proteomics workflow for MHC immunopeptidome profiling. Furthermore, we summarize 40 recently published reports addressing the fundamental theory, breakthrough and most advanced updates for the mass spectrometry-based neoantigen discovery for cancer immunotherapy. © 2019 The Authors},

However, immune checkpoint inhibitors are highly dependent on the ability to present diverse tumor antigens to T cells. Neoantigens, arising from somatic mutations and specifically targeting tumor cells, have the potential to stimulate a highly specific immune anti-tumor response. Technological advances such as genomic sequencing and bioinformatics algorithms for epitope prediction have directly facilitated the development of neoantigen vaccines for individual cancers. Currently, several preclinical studies and early clinical trials using neoantigen in combination with checkpoint inhibitors have resulted in robust T cell responses and antitumor action. In the future, efforts will be made to optimize effective personalized neoantigen vaccines targeting individual tumors and to elucidate the immune mechanisms underlying tumor evolution. © 2020.

	abstract = {Antigen-encoding, lipoplex-formulated RNA (RNA-LPX) enables systemic delivery to lymphoid compartments and selective expression in resident antigen-presenting cells. We report here that the rejection of CT26 tumors, mediated by local radiotherapy (LRT), is further augmented in a CD8+ T cell-dependent manner by an RNA-LPX vaccine that encodes CD4+ T cell-recognized neoantigens (CD4 neoantigen vaccine). Whereas CD8+ T cells induced by LRT alone were primarily directed against the immunodominant gp70 antigen, mice treated with LRT plus the CD4 neoantigen vaccine rejected gp70-negative tumors and were protected from rechallenge with these tumors, indicating a potent poly-antigenic CD8+ T cell response and T cell memory. In the spleens of CD4 neoantigen-vaccinated mice, we found a high number of activated, poly-functional, Th1-like CD4+ T cells against ME1, the immunodominant CD4 neoantigen within the poly-neoantigen vaccine. LRT itself strongly increased CD8+ T cell numbers and clonal expansion. However, tumor infiltrates of mice treated with CD4 neoantigen vaccine/LRT, as compared to LRT alone, displayed a higher fraction of activated gp70-specific CD8+ T cells, lower PD-1/LAG-3 expression and contained ME1-specific IFNγ+ CD4+ T cells capable of providing cognate help. CD4 neoantigen vaccine/LRT treatment followed by anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy further enhanced the efficacy with complete remission of gp70-negative CT26 tumors and survival of all mice. Our data highlight the power of combining synergistic modes of action and warrants further exploration of the presented treatment schema. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Current methods used for neoantigen prediction focus on the binding between human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and peptides, which is insufficient for high-confidence neoantigen prediction. In this study, we apply deep learning techniques to predict neoantigens considering both the possibility of HLA-peptide binding (binding model) and the potential immunogenicity (immunogenicity model) of the peptide-HLA complex (pHLA). The binding model achieves comparable performance with other well-acknowledged tools on the latest Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) benchmark datasets and an independent mass spectrometry (MS) dataset. The immunogenicity model could significantly improve the prediction precision of neoantigens.

	abstract = {Proteins created from recurrent fusion genes like CBFB-MYH11 are prevalent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), often necessary for leukemogenesis, persistent throughout the disease course, and highly leukemia specific, making them attractive neoantigen targets for immunotherapy. A nonameric peptide derived from a prevalent CBFB-MYH11 fusion protein was found to be immunogenic in HLA-B*40:01+ donors. High-avidity CD8+ T cell clones isolated from healthy donors killed CBFB-MYH11+ HLA-B*40:01+ AML cell lines and primary human AML samples in vitro. CBFB-MYH11-specific T cells also controlled CBFB-MYH11+ HLA-B*40:01+ AML in vivo in a patient-derived murine xenograft model. High-avidity CBFBMYH11 epitope-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) transduced into CD8+ T cells conferred antileukemic activity in vitro. Our data indicate that the CBFB-MYH11 fusion neoantigen is naturally presented on AML blasts and enables T cell recognition and killing of AML. We provide proof of principle for immunologically targeting AML-initiating fusions and demonstrate that targeting neoantigens has clinical relevance even in low-mutational frequency cancers like fusion-driven AML. This work also represents a first critical step toward the development of TCR T cell immunotherapy targeting fusion gene-driven AML. Copyright: © 2020, American Society for Clinical Investigation.},

	abstract = {Tumor cells acquire distinct genetic characteristics as a means to survive and proliferate indefinitely. Changes in the genetic code can also translate in changes at the protein level, therefore creating a distinguishable signature unique for tumor cells, and absent in normal tissues. The presence of discernable moieties in tumors is particularly attractive because it represents a therapeutic opportunity to target tumor cells with specificity, while sparing non-transformed cells. In this sense neoantigens, short peptides containing a mutated sequence, are seen attractive therapeutic targets because of their confinement within tumor cells. Neoantigens can be recognized with high affinity and specificity by tumor-targeting T cells, which consequently can initiate a potent anti-tumor immune response. While this is feasible and it has been tested in numerous cancer types including melanoma, colon and lung cancer, to mention a few, there are technical challenges in identifying immunogenic neoantigens. In this manuscript we address the topic of neoantigen identification from tumor samples, offering a technical overview of the bioinformatic methods utilized to profile the neoantigenic load of tumor samples obtained from clinical specimens. This is meant to guide readers through the steps of neoantigen identification using genomic data, by suggesting tools and methods that can provide, with a high degree of confidence, reliable results for downstream in vitro and in vivo applications. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Neoantigens have attracted attention as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. However, accurate prediction of neoantigens is still challenging, especially in terms of its accuracy and cost. Variant detection using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data has been reported to be a low-accuracy but cost-effective tool, but the feasibility of RNA-seq data for neoantigen prediction has not been fully examined. In the present study, we used whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-seq data of tumor and matched normal samples from six breast cancer patients to evaluate the utility of RNA-seq data instead of WES data in variant calling to detect neoantigen candidates. Somatic variants were called in three protocols using: (i) tumor and normal WES data (DNA method, Dm); (ii) tumor and normal RNA-seq data (RNA method, Rm); and (iii) combination of tumor RNA-seq and normal WES data (Combination method, Cm). We found that the Rm had both high false-positive and high false-negative rates because this method depended greatly on the expression status of normal transcripts. When we compared the results of Dm with those of Cm, only 14% of the neoantigen candidates detected in Dm were identified in Cm, but the majority of the missed candidates lacked coverage or variant allele reads in the tumor RNA. In contrast, about 70% of the neoepitope candidates with higher expression and rich mutant transcripts could be detected in Cm. Our results showed that Cm could be an efficient and a cost-effective approach to predict highly expressed neoantigens in tumor samples. © 2020 The Authors.

These mutations are patient-specific, and their targeting calls for highly personalized pipelines. The promising clinical outcomes of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy have spurred interest in generating T-cell infusion products that have been selectively enriched in neoantigen (or autologous tumor) reactivity. The implementation of an isolation step, prior to T-cell in vitro expansion and reinfusion, may provide a way to improve the overall response rates achieved to date by adoptive T-cell therapies in metastatic cancer patients. Here we provide an overview of the main technologies [i.e., peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) multimers, cytokine capture, and activation markers] to enrich infiltrating or circulating T-cells in predefined neoantigen specificities (or tumor reactivity).

	abstract = {Purpose: Somatic mutations in cancer cells can give rise to novel protein sequences that can be presented by antigen-presenting cells as neoantigens to the host immune system. Tumor neoantigens represent excellent targets for immunotherapy, due to their specific expression in cancer tissue. Despite the widespread use of immunomodulatory drugs and immunotherapies that recharge T and NK cells, there has been no direct evidence that neoantigen-specific T-cell responses are elicited in multiple myeloma. Experimental Design: Using next-generation sequencing data we describe the landscape of neo-antigens in 184 patients with multiple myeloma and successfully validate neoantigen-specific T cells in patients with multiple myeloma and support the feasibility of neoantigen-based therapeutic vaccines for use in cancers with intermediate mutational loads such as multiple myeloma. Results: In this study, we demonstrate an increase in neoantigen load in relapsed patients with multiple myeloma as compared with newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma. Moreover, we identify shared neoantigens across multiple patients in three multiple myeloma oncogenic driver genes (KRAS, NRAS, and IRF4). Next, we validate neoantigen T-cell response and clonal expansion in correlation with clinical response in relapsed patients with multiple myeloma. This is the first study to experimentally validate the immunogenicity of predicted neoantigens from next-generation sequencing in relapsed patients with multiple myeloma. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that somatic mutations in multiple myeloma can be immunogenic and induce neoantigen-specific T-cell activation that is associated with antitumor activity in vitro and clinical response in vivo. Our results provide the foundation for using neoantigen targeting strategies such as peptide vaccines in future trials for patients with multiple myeloma. © 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {A low percentage of actinic keratoses progress to develop into cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The immune mechanisms that successfully control or eliminate the majority of actinic keratoses and the mechanisms of immune escape by invasive squamous cell carcinoma are not well-understood. Here, we took a systematic approach to evaluate the neoantigens present in actinic keratosis and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma specimens. We compared the number of mutations, the number of neoantigens predicted to bind MHC class I, and the number of neoantigens that are predicted to bind MHC class I and be recognized by a T cell receptor in actinic keratoses and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. We also considered the relative binding strengths to both MHC class I and the T cell receptor in a fitness cost model that allows for a comparison of the immune recognition potential of the neoantigens in actinic keratosis and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma samples. The fitness cost was subsequently adjusted by the expression rates of the neoantigens to examine the role of neoantigen expression in tumor immune evasion. Our analyses indicate that, while the number of mutations and neoantigens are not significantly different between actinic keratoses and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, the predicted immune recognition of the neoantigen with the highest expression-adjusted fitness cost is lower for cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas compared with actinic keratoses. These findings suggest a role for the down-regulation of expression of highly immunogenic neoantigens in the immune escape of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. Furthermore, these findings highlight the importance of incorporating additional factors, such as the quality and expression of the neoantigens, rather than focusing solely on tumor mutational burden, in assessing immune recognition potential. © Copyright © 2019 Borden, Kang, Natri, Phung, Wilson, Buetow and Hastings.},

	abstract = {Oncolytic viruses offer an in situ vaccination approach to activate tumor-specific T cell responses. However, the upregulation of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and immune cells leads to tumor resistance to oncolytic immunotherapy. In this study, we generate an engineered oncolytic virus that coexpresses a PD-L1 inhibitor and GM-CSF. We find that the oncolytic virus is able to secrete the PD-L1 inhibitor that systemically binds and inhibits PD-L1 on tumor cells and immune cells. Importantly, the intratumoral injection with the oncolytic virus overcomes PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression during both the priming and effector phases, provokes systemic T cell responses against dominant and subdominant neoantigen epitopes derived from mutations, and leads to an effective rejection of both virus-injected and distant tumors. In summary, this engineered oncolytic virus is able to activate tumor neoantigen-specific T cell responses, providing a potent, individual tumor-specific oncolytic immunotherapy for cancer patients, especially those resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Emerging data suggest that recognition of patient-specific mutation-associated cancer antigens may allow scientists to dissect the immune response in the activity of clinical immunotherapies. On the other hand, studies indicate that more than 90% of human genes are alternatively spliced. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technology has provided a comprehensive view of both splicing aberrations and somatic mutations across a range of human malignancies. We introduced a computational method that works on both short-read and long-read sequencing data, which allows us to significantly improve the detection of cancer antigens resulting from alternative splicing variants, insertions, deletions and point mutations. Subsequent analysis of these cancer antigen candidates with widely used tools such as netMHC allows for the accurate in silico prediction of neoantigens. These altered peptide sequences may elicit immune responses such as T-cell recognition and tumor cell clearance if they are properly presented by the immune system and have a far-reaching impact on the prediction of clinical benefits to immunotherapy.  © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.},

	abstract = {The immunogenic clonal-fraction threshold in heterogeneous solid-tumor required to induce effective bystander-killing of non-immunogenic subclones is unknown. Pancreatic cancer poses crucial challenges for immune therapeutic interventions due to low mutational-burden and consequent lack of neoantigens. Here, we designed a model to incorporate artificial-neoantigens into genes-of -interest in cancer-cells and to test their potential to actuate bystander-killing. By precisely controlling a neoantigen's abundance in the tumor, we studied the impact of neoantigen frequency on immune-response and immune-escape. Our results showed single, strong, widely-expressed neoantigen could lead to robust antitumor response when over 80% of cancer cells express the neoantigen. Further, immunological assays demonstrated T-cell responses against non-target self-antigen on KRAS-oncoprotein, when we inoculated animals with a high frequency of tumor-cells expressing test-neoantigen. Using nanoparticle-based gene-therapy, we successfully altered tumor-microenvironment by perturbing interleukin-12 and interleukin-10 gene-expression. The subsequent microenvironment-remodeling reduced the neoantigen frequency threshold at which bioluminescent signal intensity for tumor-burden decreased 1.5-log-fold, marking robust tumor-growth inhibition, from 83% to 29%. Our results thus suggest bystander killing is inefficient in immunologically-cold tumors like pancreatic-cancer and requires high neoantigen abundance. However, bystander killing mediated antitumor response can be rescued by adjuvant-immune therapy. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Neoantigens can function as actual antigens to facilitate tumor rejection, which play a crucial role in cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Emerging evidence revealed that neoantigens can be used to develop personalized, cancer-specific vaccines. To date, large numbers of immunogenomic peptides have been computationally predicted to be potential neoantigens. However, experimental validation remains the gold standard for potential clinical application. Experimentally validated neoantigens are rare and mostly appear scattered among scientific papers and various databases. Here, we constructed dbPepNeo, a specific database for human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) binding neoantigen peptides based on mass spectrometry (MS) validation or immunoassay in human tumors. According to the verification methods of these neoantigens, the collection of peptides was classified as 295 high confidence, 247 medium confidence and 407 794 low confidence neoantigens, respectively. This can serve as a valuable resource to aid further screening for effective neoantigens, optimize a neoantigen prediction pipeline and study T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition. Three applications of dbPepNeo are shown. In summary, this work resulted in a platform to promote the screening and confirmation of potential neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy.

	abstract = {Background: Patient derived organoids (PDOs) can be established from colorectal cancers (CRCs) as in vitro models to interrogate cancer biology and its clinical relevance. We applied mass spectrometry (MS) immunopeptidomics to investigate neoantigen presentation and whether this can be augmented through interferon gamma (IFNγ) or MEK-inhibitor treatment. Methods: Four microsatellite stable PDOs from chemotherapy refractory and one from a treatment naïve CRC were expanded to replicates with 100 million cells each, and HLA class I and class II peptide ligands were analyzed by MS. Results: We identified an average of 9936 unique peptides per PDO which compares favorably against published immunopeptidomics studies, suggesting high sensitivity. Loss of heterozygosity of the HLA locus was associated with low peptide diversity in one PDO. Peptides from genes without detectable expression by RNA-sequencing were rarely identified by MS. Only 3 out of 612 non-silent mutations encoded for neoantigens that were detected by MS. In contrast, computational HLA binding prediction estimated that 304 mutations could generate neoantigens. One hundred ninety-six of these were located in expressed genes, still exceeding the number of MS-detected neoantigens 65-fold. Treatment of four PDOs with IFNγupregulated HLA class I expression and qualitatively changed the immunopeptidome, with increased presentation of IFNγ-inducible genes. HLA class II presented peptides increased dramatically with IFNγtreatment. MEK-inhibitor treatment showed no consistent effect on HLA class I or II expression or the peptidome. Importantly, no additional HLA class I or II presented neoantigens became detectable with any treatment. Conclusions: Only 3 out of 612 non-silent mutations encoded for neoantigens that were detectable by MS. Although MS has sensitivity limits and biases, and likely underestimated the true neoantigen burden, this established a lower bound of the percentage of non-silent mutations that encode for presented neoantigens, which may be as low as 0.5%. This could be a reason for the poor responses of non-hypermutated CRCs to immune checkpoint inhibitors. MEK-inhibitors recently failed to improve checkpoint-inhibitor efficacy in CRC and the observed lack of HLA upregulation or improved peptide presentation may explain this. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: Salivary gland carcinomas (SGC) are rare, aggressive cancers with high rates of recurrence and distant metastasis. These factors, and a lack of active systemic therapies, contribute to poor clinical outcome. Response rates with immune checkpoint blockade have been low, although clinical data remain sparse. To improve the efﬁcacy of therapies, a more comprehensive understanding of relevant molecular alterations and immunologic processes is needed. Experimental Design: To characterize the immune microenvironment and neoantigen landscape of SGCs, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in 76 tumors representing the three most lethal histologies: adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), myoepithelial carcinoma (MECA), and salivary duct carcinoma (SDC). We analyzed transcriptomic proﬁles, tumor-inﬁltrating immune cell populations, and measures of T-cell activation/dysfunction. In 37 cases also undergoing exome sequencing, we analyzed somatic mutations and neoantigens. Results: SDCs exhibited high levels of immune inﬁltration, with corresponding higher levels of T-cell dysfunction, and higher mutational load. In contrast, ACCs were characterized by an immune-excluded microenvironment, the presence of M2-polarized macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and very low mutational load. MECAs were more heterogeneous, with both immune-low and immune-high phenotypes represented. Across all SGCs, levels of immune inﬁltration were associated with mutation- and fusion-derived neoantigens, and with aggressive clinical behavior. Conclusions: These ﬁndings provide new insights into the immune microenvironment and neoantigen landscape of SGCs, showing that mechanisms of immune escape appear to differ by histology. These data nominate potential immunologic vulnerabilities and may help guide the next steps of investigation in precision immunotherapy for these difﬁcult-to-treat cancers. © 2020 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND. Therapeutic vaccinations against cancer have mainly targeted differentiation antigens, cancer-testis antigens, and overexpressed antigens and have thus far resulted in little clinical benefit. Studies conducted by multiple groups have demonstrated that T cells recognizing neoantigens are present in most cancers and offer a specific and highly immunogenic target for personalized vaccination. METHODS. We recently developed a process using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to identify the specific immunogenic mutations expressed in patients’ tumors. Here, validated, defined neoantigens, predicted neoepitopes, and mutations of driver genes were concatenated into a single mRNA construct to vaccinate patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancer. RESULTS. The vaccine was safe and elicited mutation-specific T cell responses against predicted neoepitopes not detected before vaccination. Furthermore, we were able to isolate and verify T cell receptors targeting KRASG12D mutation. We observed no objective clinical responses in the 4 patients treated in this trial. CONCLUSION. This vaccine was safe, and potential future combination of such vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors or adoptive T cell therapy should be evaluated for possible clinical benefit in patients with common epithelial cancers.

	abstract = {Cynics point out that a cure for cancer has been “around the corner” for the last 50 years. Nevertheless, the recent con-vergence of deep DNA, RNA, and proteomic technologies with enhanced understanding of the nuances of the adaptive immune system has generated great optimism amongst researchers. The extraordinary heterogeneity of various cancers, once thought to be a major therapeutic hurdle, may now be bypassed via “personalized” vaccine treatments. Specifically, these treatments involve the identification of MHC-bound peptides that are unique to a patient’s cancer (neoantigens), followed by immunization with peptides, RNA, or DNA that encodes these neoantigens via various delivery systems, thus amplifying the immune system’s response to the particular cancer. Such approaches have shown dramatic results in animal studies. Not surprisingly, then, the field of neoantigen-based immunotherapy has advanced at a spectacular rate, necessitating that interested individuals stay apprised of recent developments. Following an introduction to the subject, we thus focus on aspects that are particularly fast-moving; the cellular sources of neoantigens, which are surprisingly diverse, the tools that are used for their identification, and the status of the numerous clinical trials that are now being conducted. © 2020, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand.

	abstract = {Neoantigens are tumor-specific mutated proteins that are exempt from central tolerance and are therefore capable of efficiently eliciting effective T-cell responses. The identification of immunogenic neoantigens in tumor-specific mutated proteins has promising clinical implications for cancer immunotherapy. However, the factors that may contribute to neoantigen immunogenicity are not yet fully understood. Through molecular mimicry of antigens arising during cancer progression, the gut microbiota and previously encountered pathogens potentially have profound impacts on T-cell responses to previously unencountered tumor neoantigens. Here, we review the characteristics of immunogenic neoantigens and how host exposure to microbes may affect T-cell responses to neoantigens. We address the hypothesis that pre-existing heterologous memory T-cell immunity is a major factor that influences neoantigen immunogenicity in individual cancer patients. Accumulating data suggest that differences in individual histories of microbial exposure should be taken into account during the optimisation of algorithms that predict neoantigen immunogenicity. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: Personalized cancer vaccines based on tumor-derived neoantigens have shown strong and long-lasting antitumor effect in patients with some solid tumors. However, whether neoantigens identified from primary lesions could represent their metastatic lesions, and consequently the effect of vaccine therapy remained unknown. Methods: To investigate whether neoantigens identified from primary tumors are similar to their matched metastases in lung cancer, we identified 79 samples from 24 cases. All of samples were collected before any systemic therapy. Major criteria for neoantigen identification included: derived from tumor-specific mutations, fold change >10 comparing to germline expression level, high predicted human leukocyte antigen (HLA) binding affinity and peptide of 9–11 amino acids in length. Results: We found a wide range of tumor neoantigen burden in both primaries and metastases. The counts, overall distribution pattern and predicted HLA binding affinity of neoantigens were similar between primaries and metastases. However, only 20% of shared neoantigens (presented in both primaries and metastases) was observed, which were mainly derived from single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and fusions. A variety of corresponding HLA alleles were observed and 50.0% of cases were HLA-C*06:02. Finally, we observed the neoantigen intrametastases homogeneity in patients with sole brain metastases. Conclusions: Neoantigen landscape in terms of the number, type and predicted HLA binding affinity was similar between primaries and metastases, but the percentage of shared neoantigens is only modest, suggesting vaccine development based solely on primary tumor neoantigen may not offer optimal therapeutic outcome, and shared neoantigen needs to be seriously considered. © Translational lung cancer research.

	abstract = {Introduction: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most prevalent primary brain tumor. In spite of the rigorous multimodal treatment involving surgery and radiochemotherapy, GBM has a dismal prognosis and rapid relapsing potential. Hence, search for novel therapeutic agents still continues. Neoantigens are the tumor-specific antigens which arise due to somatic mutations in the tumor genome. In recent years, personalized vaccine approach targeting neoantigens has been explored widely in cancer immunotherapy and several efforts have also been made to revolutionize the immunotherapy of cold tumors such as GBM using neoantigen targeted vaccines. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the clinical application of personalized neoantigen targeted vaccine strategy in GBM immunotherapy. While discussing this strategy, we brief about the current challenges faced in GBM treatment by the novel immunotherapeutics. Expert opinion: To date, very few vaccines developed for GBM have reached till phase III clinical development. Early-phase clinical trials of GBM neoantigen vaccines have shown promising clinical outcomes and therefore, its rapid clinical development is warranted. Advent of newer and faster techniques such as next-generation sequencing will drive the faster clinical development of multiplex neoantigen vaccines and hence, increase in the clinical trials is expected. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) often have good clinical activity against non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations. Osimertinib, which is a third-generation EGFR-TKI, has a clinical effect even on NSCLC harboring the threonine to methionine change at codon 790 of EGFR (EGFR T790M) mutation that causes TKI resistance. However, most NSCLC patients develop acquired resistance to osimertinib within approximately 1 year, and 40% of these patients have the EGFR T790M and cysteine to serine change at codon 797 (C797S) mutations. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of novel treatment strategies for NSCLC patients with the EGFR T790M/C797S mutation. In this study, we identified the EGFR T790M/C797S mutation-derived peptide (790-799) (MQLMPFGSLL) that binds the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02:01, and successfully established EGFR T790M/C797S-peptide-specific CTL clones from human PBMC of HLA-A2 healthy donors. One established CTL clone demonstrated adequate cytotoxicity against T2 cells pulsed with the EGFR T790M/C797S peptide. This CTL clone also had high reactivity against cancer cells that expressed an endogenous EGFR T790M/C797S peptide using an interferon-γ (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. In addition, we demonstrated using a mouse model that EGFR T790M/C797S peptide-specific CTL were induced by EGFR T790M/C797S peptide vaccine in vivo. These findings suggest that an immunotherapy targeting a neoantigen derived from EGFR T790M/C797S mutation could be a useful novel therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients with EGFR-TKI resistance, especially those resistant to osimertinib. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Stimulating an immune response against cancer through adoptive transfer of tumor-targeting lymphocytes has shown great promise in hematological malignancies, but clinical efficacy against many common solid epithelial cancers remains low. Targeting ‘neoantigens’—the somatic mutations expressed only by tumor cells—might enable tumor destruction without causing undue damage to vital healthy tissues. Major challenges to targeting neoantigens with T cells include heterogeneity and variability in antigen processing and presentation of targets by tumors, and an incomplete understanding of which T cell qualities are essential for clinically effective therapies. Finally, the prospect of targeting somatic tumor mutations to promote T cell destruction of cancer must contend with the biology that not all tumor-expressed ‘neoepitopes’ actually generate neoantigens that can be functionally recognized and provoke an effective immune response. In this Review, we discuss the promise, progress and challenges for improving neoantigen-targeted T cell–based immunotherapies for cancer. © 2019, Springer Nature America, Inc.},

	abstract = {Tumor neoantigens are important targets for immunotherapy. Based on high-throughput tumor genomic analysis, each missense mutation can potentially give rise to multiple neopeptides, numerous false positive neoantigens will be produced, experimental verification would require immense time and experience. Specific identification of immunogenic candidate neoantigens is consequently a major challenge. Here we introduce a workflow to predict and filter neoantigens of breast cancer with proteogenomic methodology, which can be beneficial to high quality identification of neoantigens. We found that C2 (IFN - γdominant) immunophenotype possessed the most number of neoantigens. C2 immunophenotype shows the highest M1/M2 macrophage polarization, a strong CD8 signal and the greatest T cell receptor(TCR) diversity, which may lead to more neoantigen number than in other immunophenotypes of breast cancer. In addition, we also observed that there is a positive linear relationship between neoantigen number and tumor mutation burden. By further screening for predicted tumor mutant peptides using mass spectral data of breast cancer, we found that more than 20 000 predicted neoantigens were reduced to dozens of mutant peptides in protein expression level, the corresponding mutant genes could be further analyzed. Finally, in order to define which neoantigens were more likely to be immunogenic, TCR recognition probability was calculated using blastp method. In this study, proteomics data was used to further screen the predicted neoantigens, which improved the prediction accuracy of neoantigens, and could greatly reduce the validation scope of potential subsequent experiments. This workflow provides a new insight for tumor neoantigen prediction and screening. © 2019 Institute of Biophysics,Chinese Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

We utilized whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing (RNASeq), and an in silico immunogenicity prediction algorithm, NetMHC, to generate a neoantigen-targeted vaccine, PancVAX, which was administered together with the STING adjuvant ADU-V16 to mice bearing pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Panc02) cells. PancVAX activated a neoepitope-specific T cell repertoire within the tumor and caused transient tumor regression. When given in combination with two checkpoint modulators, namely anti-PD-1 and agonist OX40 antibodies, PancVAX resulted in enhanced and more durable tumor regression and a survival benefit. The addition of OX40 to vaccine reduced the coexpression of T cell exhaustion markers, Lag3 and PD-1, and resulted in rejection of tumors upon contralateral rechallenge, suggesting the induction of T cell memory. Together, these data provide the framework for testing personalized neoantigen-based combinatorial vaccine strategies in patients with pancreatic and other nonimmunogenic cancers.},

	abstract = {Intrapulmonary immune reactions are impaired by the tolerogenic environment of the lung. This is manifested by the absence of effective endogenous T cell responses upon neoantigen expression. This tolerance is considered to contribute to lung cancer and inefficient immune therapeutic interventions. To investigate the mechanisms contributing to lung tolerance and to overcome these restrictions, we developed a transgenic mouse model with induction of a neoantigen (OVA) exclusively in alveolar type II epithelial cells. This model is characterized by the absence of functional endogenous T cell responses upon OVA neoantigen induction. Standard DNA and protein vaccination protocols resulted in the accumulation of high numbers of antigen-specific CD8 T cells in the lung. However, clearance of antigen-expressing cells was not achieved. To overcome this tolerance, we induced inflammatory conditions by coapplication of the TLR ligands LPS and CpG-ODN during intrapulmonary vaccinations. Both ligands induced high numbers of neoantigen-specific T cells in the lung. However, only coapplication of CpG-ODN was sufficient to establish functional cytotoxic responses resulting in the elimination of neoantigen presenting target cells. Remarkably, CpG-ODN was also crucial for functional memory responses upon re-induction of the neoantigen. The results highlight the need of TLR9 co-stimulation for overcoming tolerization, which might be a key factor for therapeutic interventions. © 2017 Riehn, Cebula, Hauser and Wirth.},

	abstract = {Early recognition of neoantigen-expressing cells is complex, involving multiple immune cell types. In this study, in vivo, we examined how antigen-presenting cell subtypes coordinate and induce an immunological response against neoantigen-expressing cells, particularly in the absence of a pathogen-associated molecular pattern, which is normally required to license antigen-presenting cells to present foreign or self-antigens as immunogens. Using two reductionist models of neoantigen-expressing cells and two cancer models, we demonstrated that natural IgM is essential for the recognition and initiation of adaptive immunity against neoantigen-expressing cells. Natural IgM antibodies form a cellular immune complex with the neoantigen-expressing cells. This immune complex licenses surveying monocytes to present neoantigens as immunogens to CD41 T cells. CD41 T helper cells, in turn, use CD40L to license cross-presenting CD401 Batf31 dendritic cells to elicit a cytotoxic T cell response against neoantigen-expressing cells. Any break along this immunological chain reaction results in the escape of neoantigen-expressing cells. This study demonstrates the surprising, essential role of natural IgM as the initiator of a sequential signaling cascade involving multiple immune cell subtypes. This sequence is required to coordinate an adaptive immune response against neoantigen-expressing cells. Copyright © 2018 by the American Thoracic Society},

	abstract = {In melanoma, initiating oncogenic mutations in BRAF or NRAS are detected in premalignant lesions that accumulate additional mutations and genomic instability as the tumor evolves to the metastatic state. Here we investigate evolution of clonal composition and neoantigen landscape in an atypical melanoma displaying recurrent cutaneous lesions over a 6-year period without development of extracutaneous metastases. Whole exome sequencing of four cutaneous lesions taken during the 6-year period identified a collection of single nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions shared among all tumors, along with progressive selection of subclones displaying fewer single nucleotide variants. Later tumors also displayed lower neoantigen burden compared to early tumors, suggesting that clonal evolution was driven, at least in part, by counter selection of subclones with high neoantigen burdens. Among the selected mutations are a missense mutation in MAP2K1 (F53Y) and an inversion on chromosome 7 generating a AKAP9-BRAF fusion. The mutant proteins cooperatively activate the MAPK signaling pathway confirming they are potential driver mutations of this tumor. We therefore describe the long-term genetic evolution of cutaneous metastatic melanoma characterized by an unexpected phenotypic stability and neoantigen-driven clonal selection. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {                             Mutated peptides (neoantigens) from a patient's cancer genome can serve as targets for T-cell immunity, but identifying which peptides can be presented by an MHC molecule and elicit T cells has been difficult. Although algorithms that predict MHC binding exist, they are not yet able to distinguish experimental differences in halflives of the complexes (an immunologically relevant parameter, referred to here as kinetic stability). Improvement in determining actual neoantigen peptide/MHC stability could be important, as only a small fraction of peptides in most current vaccines are capable of eliciting CD8                             +                              T-cell responses. Here, we used a rapid, highthroughput method to experimentally determine peptide/ HLA thermal stability on a scale that will be necessary for analysis of neoantigens from thousands of patients. The method combined the use of UV-cleavable peptide/ HLA class I complexes and differential scanning fluorimetry to determine the T                             m                              values of neoantigen complexes. Measured T                             m                              values were accurate and reproducible and were directly proportional to the half-lives of the complexes. Analysis of known HLA-A2-restricted immunogenic peptides showed that T                             m                              values better correlated with immunogenicity than algorithm-predicted binding affinities. We propose that temperature stability information can be used as a guide for the selection of neoantigens in cancer vaccines in order to focus attention on those mutated peptides with the highest probability of being expressed on the cell surface.                          © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {T cells can recognize peptides encoded by mutated genes, but analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes suggests that very few neoantigens spontaneously elicit T-cell responses. This may be an important reason why immune checkpoint inhibitors are mainly effective in tumors with a high mutational burden. Reasons for clinically insufficient responses to neoantigens might be inefficient priming, inhibition, or deletion of the cognate T cells. Responses can be dramatically improved by cancer immunotherapy such as checkpoint inhibition, but often with temporary effects. By contrast, T cells from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors can cure diseases such as chronic myeloid leukemia. The therapeutic effect is mediated by donor T cells recognizing polymorphic peptides for which the donor and patient are disparate, presented on self-HLA. Donor T-cell repertoires are unbiased by the immunosuppressive environment of the tumor. A recent study demonstrated that T cells from healthy individuals are able to respond to neoantigens that are ignored by tumor-infiltrating T cells of melanoma patients. In this review, we discuss possible reasons why neoantigens escape host T cells and how these limitations may be overcome by utilization of donor-derived T-cell repertoires to facilitate rational design of neoantigen-targeted immunotherapy. © 2017 Karpanen and Olweus.},

	abstract = {CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells have an essential function in maintaining self-tolerance; however, they may also play a detrimental role in antitumor immune responses. The presence of elevated frequencies of Treg cells in tumors correlates with disease progression and poor survival in patients with cancer. The antigen specificity of Treg cells that have expanded in the tumor microenvironment is poorly understood; answering this question may provide important insights for immunotherapeutic approaches. To address this, we used a novel combinatorial approach to characterizing the T cell receptor (TCR) profiles of intratumoral Treg cells from patients with metastatic melanoma, gastrointestinal, and ovarian cancers and elucidated their antigen specificities. The TCR repertoires of tumor-resident Treg cells were diverse yet displayed significant overlap with circulating Treg cells but not with conventional T cells in tumor or blood. TCRs isolated from Treg cells displayed specific reactivity against autologous tumors and mutated neoantigens, suggesting that intratumoral Treg cells act in a tumor antigen–selective manner leading to their activation and clonal expansion in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor antigen–specific Treg-derived TCRs resided in the tumor and in the circulation, suggesting that both Treg cell compartments may serve as a source for tumor-specific TCRs. These findings provide insights into the TCR specificity of tumor-infiltrating human Treg cells that may have potential implications for cancer immunotherapy.

	abstract = {All tumors accumulate genetic alterations, some of which can give rise to mutated, non-self peptides presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules and elicit T-cell responses. These immunogenic mutated peptides, or neoantigens, are foreign in nature and display exquisite tumor specificity. The correlative evidence suggesting they play an important role in the effectiveness of various cancer immunotherapies has triggered the development of vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies targeting them. However, the systematic identification of personalized neoantigens in cancer patients, a critical requisite for the success of these therapies, remains challenging. A growing amount of evidence supports that only a small fraction of all tumor somatic non-synonymous mutations (NSM) identified represent bona fide neoantigens; mutated peptides that are processed, presented on the cell surface HLA molecules of cancer cells and are capable of triggering immune responses in patients. Here, we provide an overview of the existing strategies to identify candidate neoantigens and to evaluate their immunogenicity, two factors that impact on neoantigen identification. We will focus on their strengths and limitations to allow readers to rationally select and apply the most suitable method for their specific laboratory setting.

	abstract = {The chemokine CXCL13 mediates recruitment of B cells to tumors and is essential for the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). TLSs are thought to support antitumor immunity and are associated with improved prognosis. However, it remains unknown whether TLSs are formed in response to the general inflammatory character of the tumor microenvironment, or rather, are induced by (neo)antigen-specific adaptive immunity. We here report on the finding that the TGFb-dependent CD103þCD8þ tumor-infiltrating T-cell (TIL) subpopulation expressed and produced CXCL13. Accordingly,; CD8þ T cells from peripheral blood activated in the presence of TGFb upregulated CD103 and secreted CXCL13. Conversely, inhibition of TGFb receptor signaling abrogated CXCL13 production. CXCL13þCD103þCD8þ TILs correlated with B-cell recruitment, TLSs, and neoantigen burden in six cohorts of human tumors. Altogether, our findings indicated that TGFb plays a noncanonical role in coordinating immune responses against human tumors and suggest a potential role for CXCL13þCD103þCD8þ TILs in mediating B-cell recruitment and TLS formation in human tumors. © 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Background: Neoantigens that arise as a consequence of tumor-specific mutations can be recognized by T lymphocytes leading to effective immune surveillance. In colorectal cancer (CRC) and other tumor types, a high number of neoantigens is associated with patient response to immune therapies. The molecular processes governing the generation of neoantigens and their turnover in cancer cells are poorly understood. We exploited CRC as a model system to understand how alterations in DNA repair pathways modulate neoantigen profiles over time. Methods: We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in CRC cell lines, in vitro and in vivo, and in CRC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to track longitudinally genomic profiles, clonal evolution, mutational signatures, and predicted neoantigens. Results: The majority of CRC models showed remarkably stable mutational and neoantigen profiles; however, those carrying defects in DNA repair genes continuously diversified. Rapidly evolving and evolutionary stable CRCs displayed characteristic genomic signatures and transcriptional profiles. Downregulation of molecules implicated in antigen presentation occurred selectively in highly mutated and rapidly evolving CRC. Conclusions: These results indicate that CRCs carrying alterations in DNA repair pathways display dynamic neoantigen patterns that fluctuate over time. We define CRC subsets characterized by slow and fast evolvability and link this phenotype to downregulation of antigen-presenting cellular mechanisms. Longitudinal monitoring of the neoantigen landscape could be relevant in the context of precision medicine. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: Characterization of tumor antigen–specific CD4 T-cell responses in healthy donors and malignant melanoma patients using an in vitro amplified T-cell library screening procedure. Patients and Methods: A high-throughput, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-independent approach was used to estimate at unprecedented high sensitivity level precursor frequencies of tumor antigen- and neoantigen-specific CD4 T cells in healthy donors and patients with cancer. Frequency estimation was combined with isolation and functional characterization of identified tumor-reactive CD4 T-cell clones. Results: In healthy donors, we report frequencies of na€ve tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-specific CD4 T cells comparable with those of CD4 T cells specific for infectious agents (Tetanus toxoid). Interestingly, we also identified low, but consistent numbers of memory CD4 T cells specific for several TAAs. In patients with melanoma, low frequencies of circulating TAA-specific CD4 T cells were detected that increased after peptide-based immunotherapy. Such antitumor TAA-specific CD4 T-cell responses were also detectable within the tumor-infiltrated tissues. TAA-specific CD4 T cells in patients displayed a highly polyfunctional state, with partial skewing to Type-2 polarization. Finally, we report the applicability of this approach to the detection and amplification of neoantigen-specific CD4 T cells. Conclusions: This simple, noninvasive, high-throughput screening of tumor- and neoantigen-specific CD4 T cells requires little biologic material, is HLA class II independent and allows the concomitant screening for a large number of tumor antigens of interest, including neoantigens. This approach will facilitate the immunomonitoring of preexisting and therapy-induced CD4 T-cell responses, and accelerate the development of CD4 T-cell–based therapies. 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {                             Cancer vaccines targeting patient-specific tumor neoantigens have recently emerged as a promising component of the rapidly expanding immunotherapeutic armamentarium. However, neoantigenic peptides typically elicit weak CD8                             +                              T cell responses, and so there is a need for universally applicable vaccine delivery strategies to enhance the immunogenicity of these peptides. Ideally, such vaccines could also be rapidly fabricated using chemically synthesized peptide antigens customized to an individual patient. Here, we describe a strategy for simple and rapid packaging of peptide antigens into pH-responsive nanoparticles with endosomal escape activity. Electrostatically-stabilized polyplex nanoparticles (nanoplexes) can be assembled instantaneously by mixing decalysine-modified antigenic peptides and poly(propylacrylic acid) (pPAA), a polyanion with pH-dependent, membrane destabilizing activity. These nanoplexes increase and prolong antigen uptake and presentation on MHC-I (major histocompatibility complex class I) molecules expressed by dendritic cells, resulting in enhanced activation of CD8                             +                              T cells. Using an intranasal immunization route, nanoplex vaccines inhibit formation of lung metastases in a murine melanoma model. Additionally, nanoplex vaccines strongly synergize with the adjuvant α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) in stimulating robust CD8                             +                              T cell responses, significantly increasing survival time in mice with established melanoma tumors. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that peptide/pPAA nanoplexes offer a facile and versatile platform for enhancing CD8                             +                              T cell responses to peptide antigens, with potential to complement ongoing advancements in the development of neoantigen-targeted cancer vaccines.                          © 2018},

	abstract = {Background: There is strong evidence that immunotherapy-mediated tumor rejection can be driven by tumor-specific CD8+ T cells reinvigorated to recognize neoantigens derived from tumor somatic mutations. Thus, the frequencies or characteristics of tumor-reactive, mutation-specific CD8+ T cells could be used as biomarkers of an anti-tumor response. However, such neoantigen-specific T cells are difficult to reliably identify due to their low frequency in peripheral blood and wide range of potential epitope specificities. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 14 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were collected pre- and post-treatment with the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab. Using whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing we identified tumor neoantigens that are predicted to bind to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and utilized mass cytometry, together with cellular 'barcoding', to profile immune cells from patients with objective response to therapy (n = 8) and those with progressive disease (n = 6). In parallel, a highly-multiplexed combinatorial tetramer staining was used to screen antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood for 782 candidate tumor neoantigens and 71 known viral-derived control peptide epitopes across all patient samples. Results: No significant treatment- or response associated phenotypic difference were measured in bulk CD8+ T cells. Multiplexed peptide-MHC multimer staining detected 20 different neoantigen-specific T cell populations, as well as T cells specific for viral control antigens. Not only were neoantigen-specific T cells more frequently detected in responding patients, their phenotypes were also almost entirely distinct. Neoantigen-specific T cells from responder patients typically showed a differentiated effector phenotype, most like Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and some types of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific CD8+ T cells. In contrast, more memory-like phenotypic profiles were observed for neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells from patients with progressive disease. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that neoantigen-specific T cells can be detected in peripheral blood in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients during anti-PD-L1 therapy. Patients with an objective response had an enrichment of neoantigen-reactive T cells and these cells showed a phenotype that differed from patients without a response. These findings suggest the ex vivo identification, characterization, and longitudinal follow-up of rare tumor-specific differentiated effector neoantigen-specific T cells may be useful in predicting response to checkpoint blockade.

	abstract = {During their development and progression tumors acquire numerous mutations that, when translated into proteins give rise to neoantigens that can be recognized by T cells. Initially, neoantigens were not recognized as preferred targets for cancer immunotherapy due to their enormous diversity and the therefore limited options to develop "one fits all" pharmacologic solutions. In recent years, the experience obtained in clinical trials demonstrating a predictive role of neoantigens in checkpoint inhibition has changed our view on the clinical potential of neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy. Technological advances such as sequencing of whole cancer genomes, the development of reliable algorithms for epitope prediction, and an increasing number of immunotherapeutic options now facilitate the development of personalized tumor therapies directly targeting a patient's neoantigenic burden. Preclinical studies in mice that support the excellent therapeutic potential of neoantigen-directed immunotherapies have provided blueprints on how this methodology can be translated into clinical applications in humans. Consistently, very recent clinical studies on personalized vaccinations targeting in silico predicted neoepitopes shed a first light on the therapeutic potential of personalized, neoantigen-directed immunotherapies. In our review, we discuss the various subtypes of tumor antigens with a focus on neoantigens and their potential in cancer immunotherapy. We will describe the current methods and techniques of detection as well as the structural requirements for neoantigens that are needed for their recognition by T cells and for tumor destruction. To assess the clinical potential of neoantigens, we will discuss their occurrence and functional relevance in spontaneous and hereditary cancers and their prognostic and predictive value. We will present in detail the existing immunotherapeutic options that exploit the neoantigen burden of tumors encompassing both preclinical efforts that provided convincing technological proof-of-concept and the current clinical studies confirming the potential of neoantigen-directed immunotherapies. © 2017 Wirth and Kühnel.},

	abstract = {Background: The major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecule is a protein complex that displays intracellular peptides to T cells, allowing the immune system to recognize and destroy infected or cancerous cells. MHC-I is composed of a highly polymorphic HLA-encoded alpha chain that binds the peptide and a Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) protein that acts as a stabilizing scaffold. HLA mutations have been implicated as a mechanism of immune evasion during tumorigenesis, and B2M is considered a tumor suppressor gene. However, the implications of somatic HLA and B2M mutations have not been fully explored in the context of antigen presentation via the MHC-I molecule during tumor development. To understand the effect that B2M and HLA MHC-I molecule mutations have on mutagenesis, we analyzed the accumulation of mutations in patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas according to their MHC-I molecule mutation status. Results: Somatic B2M and HLA mutations in microsatellite stable tumors were associated with higher overall mutation burden and a larger fraction of HLA-binding neoantigens when compared to B2M and HLA wild type tumors. B2M and HLA mutations were highly enriched in patients with microsatellite instability. B2M mutations tended to occur relatively early during patients' respective tumor development, whereas HLA mutations were either early or late events. In addition, B2M and HLA mutated patients had higher levels of immune infiltration by natural killer and CD8+ T cells and higher levels of cytotoxicity. Conclusions: Our findings add to a growing body of evidence that somatic B2M and HLA mutations are a mechanism of immune evasion by demonstrating that such mutations are associated with a higher load of neoantigens that should be presented via MHC-I. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Cancer immunotherapy represents a promising and rapidly developing approach for the treatment of oncological diseases. Among the methods of personalized adjuvant immunotherapy, neoantigenic peptide-based drugs have demonstrated substantial efficiency. These drugs are designed to target mutant proteins arising from somatic alterations in the genome of tumor cells and thus stimulate immune response against tumor tissues. The methods of individual screening for potentially immunogenic mutations are mostly based on next-generation exome sequencing of tumor samples, which is a complex and costly procedure for clinical application. Targeted gene sequencing panels limited to a certain set of genes represent a reasonable alternative to WES. Targeted sequencing is also more efficient when there is a low amount of the sample DNA available. We have estimated the potential efficiency of targeted oncological panels in terms of somatic neoantigen profiling in colorectal cancer (colon and rectal adenocarcinoma). The clinical practice of identification of frequent somatic variants does not provide enough data for designing an efficient personalized drug when applied to low and medium mutated cancers such as colorectal cancer. Our analysis of 11 commercially available panels containing different number of genes has shown that neither the larger size of a panel nor its initial customization for colorectal cancer provides a significantly better estimation of an individual somatic mutation profile. The optimal approach is to use the general-purpose medium-sized cancer panels (2300-11200 amplicons and/or 150-600 genes). These panels allow to detect a sufficient number of immunogenic epitopes (>3) per patient for over 30-50% of patients. © 2018 Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Efficient identification of neoantigen-specific T-cell responses in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains a challenge. Existing investigations of spontaneous T-cell response to tumor neoepitope in EOC have taken the approach of comprehensive screening all neoantigen candidates, with a validation rate of 0.5-2%. Methods: Whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing analysis of treatment-naive EOC patients were performed to identify neoantigen candidates, and the immunogenicity of prioritized neoantigens was evaluated by analyzing spontaneous neoantigen-specfic CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in the tumor and/or peripheral blood. The biological relevance of neoantigen-specific T-cell lines and clones were analyzed by evaluating the capacity of autologous ovarian tumor recognition. Genetic transfer of T-cell receptor (TCR) from these neoantigen-specific T-cell clones into peripheral blood T-cells was conducted to generate neoepitope-specific T-cells. The molecular signature associated with positive neoantigen T-cell responses was investigated, and the impacts of expression level and lymphocyte source on neoantigen identification were explored. Results: Using a small subset of prioritized neoantigen candidates, we were able to detect spontaneous CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-cell responses against neoepitopes from autologous lymphocytes in half of treatment-naïve EOC patients, with a significantly improved validation rate of 19%. Tumors from patients exhibiting neoantigen-specific T-cell responses exhibited a signature of upregulated antigen processing and presentation machinery, which was also associated with favorable patient survival in the TCGA ovarian cohort. T-cells specific against two mutated cancer-associated genes, NUP214 and JAK1, recognized autologous tumors. Gene-engineering with TCR from these neoantigen-specific T-cell clones conferred neoantigen-reactivity to peripheral T-cells. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the feasibility of efficiently identifying both CD4+ and CD8+ neoantigen-specific T-cells in EOC. Autologous lymphocytes genetically engineered with tumor antigen-specific TCR can be used to generate cells for use in the personalized adoptive T-cell transfer immunotherapy. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Immune-based therapies have shown limited efficacy in glioma thus far. This might be at least in part due to insufficient numbers of neoantigens, thought to be targets of immune attack. In addition, we hypothesized that dynamic genetic and epigenetic tumor evolution in gliomas might also affect the mutation/neoantigen landscape and contribute to treatment resistance through immune evasion. Here, we investigated changes in the neoantigen landscape and immunologic features during glioma progression using exome and RNA-seq of paired primary and recurrent tumor samples obtained from 25 WHO grade II–IV glioma patients (glioblastoma, IDH-wild-type, n ¼ 8; grade II–III astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, n ¼ 9; and grade II–III oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-codeleted, n ¼ 8). The number of missense mutations, predicted neoantigens, or expressed neoantigens was not significantly different between primary and recurrent tumors. However, we found that in individual patients the ratio of expressed neoantigens to predicted neoantigens, designated the "neoantigen expression ratio," decreased significantly at recurrence (P ¼ 0.003). This phenomenon was particularly pronounced for "high-affinity," "clonal," and "passenger gene–derived" neoantigens. Gene expression and IHC analyses suggested that the decreased neoantigen expression ratio was associated with intact antigen presentation machinery, increased tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and ongoing immune responses. Our findings imply that decreased expression of highly immunogenic neoantigens, possibly due to persistent immune selection pressure, might be one of the immune evasion mechanisms along with tumor clonal evolution in some gliomas. © 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) play a major role in development of cervical cancer, and HPV oncoproteins are being targeted by immunotherapies. Although these treatments show promising results in the clinic, many patients do not benefit or the durability is limited. In addition to HPV antigens, neoantigens derived from somatic mutations may also generate an effective immune response and represent an additional and distinct immunotherapy strategy against this and other HPV-associated cancers. To explore the landscape of neoantigens in cervix cancer, we predicted all possible mutated neopeptides in two large sequencing data sets and analyzed whether mutation and neoantigen load correlate with antigen presentation, infiltrating immune cell types, and a HPV-induced master regulator gene expression signature. We found that targetable neoantigens are detected in most tumors, and there are recurrent mutated peptides from known oncogenic driver genes (KRAS, MAPK1, PIK3CA, ERBB2, and ERBB3) that are predicted to be potentially immunogenic. Our studies show that HPV-induced master regulators are not only associated with HPV load but may also play crucial roles in relation to mutation and neoantigen load, and also the immune microenvironment of the tumor. A subset of these HPV-induced master regulators positively correlated with expression of immune-suppressor molecules such as PD-L1, TGFB1, and IL-10 suggesting that they may be involved in abrogating antitumor response induced by the presence of mutations and neoantigens. Based on these results, we predict that HPV master regulators identified in our study might be potentially effective targets in cervical cancer. © 2017 Qin, Ekmekcioglu, Forget, Szekvolgyi, Hwu, Grimm, Jazaeri and Roszik.},

Following engraftment into immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, BBN tumors were more responsive to PD-1 inhibition than UPPL tumors. Responding tumors within the BBN model showed differences in immune microenvironment composition, including increased ratios of CD8+:CD4+ and memory:regulatory T cells. Finally, we predicted and confirmed immunogenicity of tumor neoantigens in each model.

	abstract = {The remarkable clinical efficacy of the immune checkpoint blockade therapies has motivated researchers to discover immunogenic epitopes and exploit them for personalized vaccines. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-binding peptides derived from processing and presentation of mutated proteins are one of the leading targets for T-cell recognition of cancer cells. Currently, most studies attempt to identify neoantigens based on predicted affinity to HLA molecules, but the performance of such prediction algorithms is rather poor for rare HLA class I alleles and for HLA class II. Direct identification of neoantigens by mass spectrometry (MS) is becoming feasible; however, it is not yet applicable to most patients and lacks sensitivity. In an attempt to capitalize on existing immunopeptidomics data and extract information that could complement HLA-binding prediction, we first compiled a large HLA class I and class II immunopeptidomics database across dozens of cell types and HLA allotypes and detected hotspots that are subsequences of proteins frequently presented. About 3% of the peptidome was detected in both class I and class II. Based on the gene ontology of their source proteins and the peptide's length, we propose that their processing may partake by the cellular class II presentation machinery. Our database captures the global nature of the in vivo peptidome averaged over many HLA alleles, and therefore, reflects the propensity of peptides to be presented on HLA complexes, which is complementary to the existing neoantigen prediction features such as binding affinity and stability or RNA abundance. We further introduce two immunopeptidomics MS-based features to guide prioritization of neoantigens: the number of peptides matching a protein in our database and the overlap of the predicted wild-type peptide with other peptides in our database. We show as a proof of concept that our immunopeptidomics MS-based features improved neoantigen prioritization by up to 50%. Overall, our work shows that, in addition to providing huge training data to improve the HLA binding prediction, immunopeptidomics also captures other aspects of the natural in vivo presentation that significantly improve prediction of clinically relevant neoantigens. © 2017 Müller, Gfeller, Coukos and Bassani-Sternberg.},

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective in treating a variety of malignancies, including metastatic bladder cancer. A generally accepted hypothesis suggests that immune checkpoint inhibitors induce tumor regressions by reactivating a population of endogenous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that recognize cancer neoantigens. Although previous studies have identified neoantigen-reactive TILs from several types of cancer, no study to date has shown whether neoantigen-reactive TILs can be found in bladder tumors. To address this, we generated TIL cultures from patients with primary bladder cancer and tested their ability to recognize tumor-specific mutations. We found that CD4+ TILs from one patient recognized mutated C-terminal binding protein 1 in an MHC class II-restricted manner. This finding suggests that neoantigen-reactive TILs reside in bladder cancer, which may help explain the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade in this disease and also provides a rationale for the future use of adoptive T cell therapy targeting neoantigens in bladder cancer. © 2019 American Association of Immunologists.

	abstract = {Cancer neoantigens are antigens that result from somatic mutations present in individual cancers. Neoantigens are considered important targets for cancer immunotherapy because of their immunogenicity and lack of expression in normal tissues. Nextgeneration sequencing technologies and computational analysis have recently made neoantigen discovery possible. Although neoantigens are important targets of checkpoint blockade therapy, neoantigen vaccines are currently being investigated in preclinical models and early-phase human clinical trials. Preliminary results from these clinical trials demonstrate that dendritic cell, synthetic long peptide, and RNA-based neoantigen vaccines are safe, and capable of inducing both CD8+ and CD4+ neoantigen-specific T-cell responses. We and others are testing neoantigen vaccines in melanoma, breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer and other cancer types. Since cancers have evolved mechanisms to escape immune control, it is particularly important to study the efficacy of neoantigen vaccines in combination with other immunotherapies including checkpoint blockade therapy, and immune therapies targeting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. © The Author 2017.

	abstract = {This study focused on HLA-A24 and comprehensively analyzed the ligandome of colon and lung cancer cells without the use of MHC-binding in silico prediction algorithms. Affinity purification using the antibody specific to HLA-A24 followed by LC–MS/MS sequencing was used to detect peptides, which harbored the known characteristics of HLA-A24 peptides in terms of length and anchor motifs. Ligandome analysis demonstrated the natural presentation of two different types of novel tumor-associated antigens. The ligandome contained a peptide derived from SUV39H2, a gene found to be expressed in a variety of cancers but not in normal tissues (except for the testis). The SUV39H2 peptide is immunogenic and elicits cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell (CTL) responses against cancer cells and is thus a novel cancer-testis antigen. Moreover, we found that microsatellite instability (MSI)-colon cancer cells displayed a neoepitope with an amino-acid substitution, while microsatellite stable (MSS)-colon and lung cancer cells displayed its counterpart peptide without the substitution. Structure modeling of peptide-HLA-A24 complexes predicted that the mutated residue at P8 was accessible to T-cell receptors. The neoepitope readily elicited CTL responses, which discriminated it from its wild-type counterpart, and the CTLs exhibited considerably high cytotoxicity against MSS-colon cancer cells carrying the responsible gene mutation. The specific and strong CTL lysis observed in this study fosters our understanding of immune surveillance against neoantigens. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Elevated neoantigen load has been previously correlated with improved outcome and response to immune checkpoint blockade in various tumor types. In endometrial cancer, previous studies of neoantigen load prediction have shown that the hypermutated MSI and POLE-mutated tumors harbor significantly higher predicted neoantigen load compared to the hypomutated CN-low/endometrioid and CN-high/serous-like tumors. Here, we report that predicted neoantigen load may be a prognostic factor in hypomutated endometrial cancers, both in CN-low/endometrioid and CN-high/serous-like tumors. Specifically, in the TCGA dataset, CN-low/endometrioid tumors with neoantigen load in the highest tertile were associated with significantly improved progression free survival (PFS) (p = 0.031), while CN-high/serous-like tumors with neoantigen load in the lowest tertile were associated with worse PFS (p = 0.041). Importantly, certain tumor-specific genomic alterations were enriched in tumors with lower neoantigen load, including CTNNB1 mutations in CN-low/endometrioid tumors and MYC amplification and PIK3CA mutations in CN-high/serous-like tumors. These findings suggest that predicted neoantigen load and specific genomic alterations (such as CTNNB1 mutations, MYC amplification and PIK3CA mutations) may be biomarkers of response to immunotherapy in hypomutated endometrial cancers, and argues that these exploratory biomarkers should be incorporated in clinical trials of immune checkpoint blockade in this disease. © 2017 The Authors},

	abstract = {To realize the full potential of immunotherapy, it is critical to understand the drivers of tumor infiltration by immune cells. Previous studies have linked immune infiltration with tumor neoantigen levels, but the broad applicability of this concept remains unknown. Here, we find that while this observation is true across cancers characterized by recurrent mutations, it does not hold for cancers driven by recurrent copy number alterations, such as breast and pancreatic tumors. To understand immune invasion in these cancers, we developed an integrative multi-omics framework, identifying the DNA damage response protein ATM as a driver of cytokine production leading to increased immune infiltration. This prediction was validated in numerous orthogonal datasets, as well as experimentally in vitro and in vivo by cytokine release and immune cell migration. These findings demonstrate diverse drivers of immune cell infiltration across cancer lineages and may facilitate the clinical adaption of immunotherapies across diverse malignancies. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Burrack et al. investigate tumor-specific T cells during immunotherapy of pancreas cancer. T cells accumulate intratumorally yet rapidly exhaust. Combined PD-1 + PD-L1 blockade promotes peripheral T cell expansion, TNFα production, and eradication of spontaneous tumor recurrence in 50% of animals. Tumor variants defective in IFNγ-inducible Tap1 and MHC class I ultimately emerge. © 2019 The Author(s); Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal cancer resistant to immunotherapy. We create a PDA mouse model and show that neoantigen expression is required for intratumoral T cell accumulation and response to immune checkpoint blockade. By generating a peptide:MHC tetramer, we identify that PDA induces rapid intratumoral, and progressive systemic, tumor-specific T cell exhaustion. Monotherapy PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade enhances systemic T cell expansion and induces objective responses that require systemic T cells. However, tumor escape variants defective in IFNγ-inducible Tap1 and MHC class I cell surface expression ultimately emerge. Combination PD-1 + PD-L1 blockade synergizes therapeutically by increasing intratumoral KLRG1+Lag3−TNFα+ tumor-specific T cells and generating memory T cells capable of expanding to spontaneous tumor recurrence, thereby prolonging animal survival. Our studies support that PD-1 and PD-L1 are relevant immune checkpoints in PDA and identify a combination for clinical testing in those patients with neoantigen-specific T cells. © 2019 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The skin hosts a variety of dendritic cells (DCs), which act as professional APC to control cutaneous immunity. Langerhans cells (LCs) are the only DC subset in the healthy epidermis. However, due to the complexity of the skin DC network, their relative contribution to either immune activation or immune tolerance is still not entirely understood. To specifically study the function of LCs in vivo, without altering the DC subset composition in the skin, we have generated transgenic mouse models for tamoxifeninducible de novo expression of Ags in LCs but no other langerin+ DCs. Therefore, this system allows for LC-restricted Ag presentation to T cells. Presentation of nonsecreted OVA (GFPOVA) by steady-state LCs resulted in transient activation of endogenous CTL in transgenic mice. However, when these mice were challenged with OVA by gene gun immunization in the contraction phase of the primary CTL response they did not respond with a recall of CTL memory but, instead, with robust Agspecific CTL tolerance.We found regulatory T cells (Tregs) enriched in the skin of tolerized mice, and depletion of Tregs or adoptive experiments revealed that Tregs were critically involved in CTL tolerance. By contrast, when OVAwas presented by activated LCs, a recallable CTL memory response developed in transgenic mice. Thus, neoantigen presentation by epidermal LCs results in either robust CTL tolerance or CTL memory, and this decision-making depends on the activation state of the presenting LCs.

	abstract = {Abstract—: Cancer immunotherapy represents a promising and rapidly developing approach for the treatment of oncological diseases. Among the methods of personalized adjuvant immunotherapy, neoantigenic peptide-based drugs have demonstrated substantial efficiency. These drugs are designed to target mutant proteins arising from somatic alterations in the genome of tumor cells and thus stimulate immune response against tumor tissues. The methods of individual screening for potentially immunogenic mutations are mostly based on next-generation exome sequencing of tumor samples, which is a complex and costly procedure for clinical application. Targeted gene sequencing panels limited to a certain set of genes represent a reasonable alternative to whole exome sequencing (WES). Targeted sequencing is also more efficient when there is a low amount of the sample DNA available. We have estimated the potential efficiency of targeted oncological panels in terms of somatic neoantigen profiling in colorectal cancer (colon and rectal adenocarcinoma). The methods of detection of some frequent somatic variants currently used in clinical practice do not provide the neoantigen profiling of the tumor sufficient for design of effective drugs for low and medium mutated cancers such as colorectal cancer. Our analysis of 11 commercially available panels covering different number of genes has shown that neither the larger size of a panel nor its initial customization for colorectal cancer provides a significantly better estimation of an individual neoantigenic profile. The optimal approach is to use the general-purpose medium-sized cancer panels (2300–11 200 amplicons and/or 150–600 genes). Such panels allow to detect a sufficient number of immunogenic epitopes (>3) for over 30–50% of patients. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Somatic frameshift mutations in the calreticulin (CALR) gene are key drivers of cellular transformation in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). All patients carrying these mutations (CALR MPN) share an identical sequence in the C-terminus of the mutated CALR + protein (mut-CALR), with the potential for utility as a shared neoantigen. Here, we demonstrate that + although a subset of patients with CALR MPN develop specific T-cell responses against the mut-CALR C-terminus, PD-1 or CTLA4 expression abrogates the full complement of responses. Significantly, blockade of PD-1 and CLTA4 ex vivo by mAbs and of PD-1 in vivo by pembrolizumab administration + restores mut-CALR–specific T-cell immunity in some patients with CALR MPN. Moreover, mut-CALR elicits antigen-specific responses from both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, confirming its broad applicability as an immunogen. Collectively, these results establish mut-CALR as a shared, MPN-specific neoantigen and inform the design of novel immunotherapies targeting mut-CALR. SIGNIFICANCE: Current treatment modalities for MPN are not effective in eliminating malignant cells. Here, we show that mutations in the CALR gene, which drive transformation in MPN, elicit T-cell responses that can be further enhanced by checkpoint blockade, suggesting immunotherapies could be employed to eliminate CALR + malignant cells in MPN. © 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.},

However, the feasibility of this approach in lower mutational burden tumors like glioblastoma (GBM) remains unknown. We have previously reported the use of an immunogenomics pipeline to identify candidate neoantigens in preclinical models of GBM. Here, we report the application of the same immunogenomics pipeline to identify candidate neoantigens and guide screening for neoantigen-specific T cell responses in a patient with GBM treated with a personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine following autologous tumor lysate DC vaccination. Following vaccination, reactivity to three HLA class I- and five HLA class II-restricted candidate neoantigens were detected by IFN-γ ELISPOT in peripheral blood. A similar pattern of reactivity was observed among isolated post-treatment tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Genomic analysis of pre- and post-treatment GBM reflected clonal remodeling. These data demonstrate the feasibility and translational potential of a therapeutic neoantigen-based vaccine approach in patients with primary CNS tumors. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown significant therapeutic responses against tumors containing increased mutation-associated neoantigen load. We have examined the evolving landscape of tumor neoantigens during the emergence of acquired resistance in patients with non-small cell lung cancer after initial response to immune checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Analyses of matched pretreatment and resistant tumors identified genomic changes resulting in loss of 7 to 18 putative mutation-associated neoantigens in resistant clones. Peptides generated from the eliminated neoantigens elicited clonal T-cell expansion in autologous T-cell cultures, suggesting that they generated functional immune responses. Neoantigen loss occurred through elimination of tumor subclones or through deletion of chromosomal regions containing truncal alterations, and was associated with changes in T-cell receptor clonality. These analyses provide insight into the dynamics of mutational landscapes during immune checkpoint blockade and have implications for the development of immune therapies that target tumor neoantigens. SIGNIFICANCE: Acquired resistance to immune checkpoint therapy is being recognized more commonly. This work demonstrates for the fi rst time that acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade can arise in association with the evolving landscape of mutations, some of which encode tumor neoantigens recognizable by T cells. These observations imply that widening the breadth of neoantigen reactivity may mitigate the development of acquired resistance. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {T-cell receptor (TCR) transfer is an attractive strategy to increase the number of cancer-specific T cells in adoptive cell therapy. However, recent clinical and pre-clinical findings indicate that careful consideration of the target antigen is required to limit the risk of off-target toxicity. Directing T cells against mutated proteins such as frequently occurring frameshift mutations may thus be a safer alternative to tumor-associated self-antigens. Furthermore, such frameshift mutations result in novel polypeptides allowing selection of TCRs from the non-tolerant T-cell repertoire circumventing the problem of low affinity TCRs due to central tolerance. The transforming growth factor β Receptor II frameshift mutation (TGFβRIImut) is found in Lynch syndrome cancer patients and in approximately 15% of sporadic colorectal and gastric cancers displaying microsatellite instability (MSI). The -1A mutation within a stretch of 10 adenine bases (nucleotides 709–718) of the TGFβRII gene gives rise to immunogenic peptides previously used for vaccination of MSI+ colorectal cancer patients in a Phase I clinical trial. From a clinically responding patient, we isolated a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone showing a restriction for HLA-A2 in complex with TGFβRIImut peptide. Its TCR was identified and shown to redirect T cells against colon carcinoma cell lines harboring the frameshift mutation. Finally, T cells transduced with the HLA-A2-restricted TGFβRIImut-specific TCR were demonstrated to significantly reduce the growth of colorectal cancer and enhance survival in a NOD/SCID xenograft mouse model. © 2017 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The adoptive transfer of neoantigen-reactive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) can result in tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancer. To improve the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy targeting these tumor-specific mutations, we have proposed a new therapeutic strategy, which involves the genetic modification of autologous T cells with neoantigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) and the transfer of these modified T cells back to cancer patients. However, the current techniques to isolate neoantigen-specific TCRs are labor intensive, time consuming, and technically challenging, not suitable for clinical applications. To facilitate this process, a new approach was developed, which included the co-culture of TILs with tandem minigene (TMG)-transfected or peptide-pulsed autologous antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and the single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of T cells to identify paired TCR sequences associated with cells expressing high levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). Following this new approach, multiple TCRs were identified, synthesized, cloned into a retroviral vector, and then transduced into donor T cells. These transduced T cells were shown to specifically recognize the neoantigens presented by autologous APCs. In conclusion, this approach provides an efficient procedure to isolate neoantigen-specific TCRs for clinical applications, as well as for basic and translational research. The identification of antigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) is a complicated process, which is technically challenging and not suitable for clinical applications. To simplify this process, Lu and colleagues developed an efficient single-cell approach, which can significantly reduce the labor and time for the TCR isolation. © 2017},

	abstract = {The interplay between an evolving cancer and a dynamic immune microenvironment remains unclear. Here we analyse 258 regions from 88 early-stage, untreated non-small-cell lung cancers using RNA sequencing and histopathology-assessed tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte estimates. Immune infiltration varied both between and within tumours, with different mechanisms of neoantigen presentation dysfunction enriched in distinct immune microenvironments. Sparsely infiltrated tumours exhibited a waning of neoantigen editing during tumour evolution, indicative of historical immune editing, or copy-number loss of previously clonal neoantigens. Immune-infiltrated tumour regions exhibited ongoing immunoediting, with either loss of heterozygosity in human leukocyte antigens or depletion of expressed neoantigens. We identified promoter hypermethylation of genes that contain neoantigenic mutations as an epigenetic mechanism of immunoediting. Our results suggest that the immune microenvironment exerts a strong selection pressure in early-stage, untreated non-small-cell lung cancers that produces multiple routes to immune evasion, which are clinically relevant and forecast poor disease-free survival. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Mutated cancer antigens, or neoantigens, represent compelling immunological targets and appear to underlie the success of several forms of immunotherapy. While there are anecdotal reports of neoantigen-specific T cells being present in the peripheral blood and/or tumors of cancer patients, effective adoptive cell therapy (ACT) against neoantigens will require reliable methods to isolate and expand rare, neoantigen-specific T cells from clinically available biospecimens, ideally prior to clinical relapse. Here, we addressed this need using “mini-lines”, large libraries of parallel T cell cultures, each originating from only 2,000 T cells. Using small quantities of peripheral blood from multiple time points in an ovarian cancer patient, we screened over 3.3 × 106 CD8+ T cells by ELISPOT for recognition of peptides corresponding to the full complement of somatic mutations (n = 37) from the patient's tumor. We identified ten T cell lines which collectively recognized peptides encoding five distinct mutations. Six of the ten T cell lines recognized a previously described neoantigen from this patient (HSDL1L25V), whereas the remaining four lines recognized peptides corresponding to four other mutations. Only the HSDL1L25V-specific T cell lines recognized autologous tumor. HSDL1L25V-specific T cells comprised at least three distinct clonotypes and could be identified and expanded from peripheral blood 3–9 months prior to the first tumor recurrence. These T cells became undetectable at later time points, underscoring the dynamic nature of the response. Thus, neoantigen-specific T cells can be expanded from small volumes of blood during tumor remission, making pre-emptive ACT a plausible clinical strategy. © 2018 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The identification of immunogenic neoantigens and their cognate T cells represents the most crucial and rate-limiting steps in the development of personalized cancer immunotherapies that are based on vaccination or on infusion of T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cells. Recent advances in deep-sequencing technologies and in silico prediction algorithms have allowed rapid identification of candidate neoepitopes. However, large-scale validation of putative neoepitopes and the isolation of reactive T cells are challenging because of the limited availablity of patient material and the low frequencies of neoepitope-specific T cells. Here we describe a standardized protocol for the induction of neoepitope-reactive T cells from healthy donor T cell repertoires, unaffected by the potentially immunosuppressive environment of the tumor-bearing host. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) transfected with mRNA encoding candidate neoepitopes are used to prime autologous naive CD8+ T cells. Antigen-specific T cells that recognize endogenously processed and presented epitopes are detected using peptide–MHC (pMHC) multimers. Single multimer-positive T cells are sorted for the identification of TCR sequences, after an optional step that includes clonal expansion and functional characterization. The time required to identify neoepitope-specific T cells is 15 d, with an additional 2–4 weeks required for clonal expansion and downstream functional characterization. Identified neoepitopes and corresponding TCRs provide candidates for use in vaccination and TCR-based cancer immunotherapies, and datasets generated by this technology should be useful for improving algorithms to predict immunogenic neoantigens. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is an effective immunotherapy for patients with solid tumors, yielding objective response rates of around 40% in refractory patients with metastatic melanoma. Most clinical centers utilize bulk, randomly isolated TIL from the tumor tissue for ex vivo expansion and infusion. Only a minor fraction of the administered T cells recognizes tumor antigens, such as shared and mutation-derived neoantigens, and consequently eliminates the tumor. Thus, there are many ongoing effects to identify and select tumor-specific TIL for therapy; however, those approaches are very costly and require months, which is unreasonable for most metastatic patients. CD137 (4-1BB) has been identified as a co-stimulatory marker, which is induced upon the specific interaction of T cells with their target cell. Therefore, CD137 can be a useful biomarker and an important tool for the selection of tumor-reactive T cells. Here, we developed and validated a simple and time efficient method for the selection of CD137-expressing T cells for therapy based on magnetic bead separation. CD137 selection was performed with clinical grade compliant reagents, and TIL were expanded in a large-scale manner to meet cell numbers required for the patient setting in a GMP facility. For the first time, the methodology was designed to comply with both clinical needs and limitations, and its feasibility was assessed. CD137-selected TIL demonstrated significantly increased antitumor reactivity and were enriched for T cells recognizing neoantigens as well as shared tumor antigens. CD137-based selection enabled the enrichment of tumor-reactive T cells without the necessity of knowing the epitope specificity or the antigen type. The direct implementation of the CD137 separation method to the cell production of TIL may provide a simple way to improve the clinical efficiency of TIL ACT. © 2017 Seliktar-Ofir, Merhavi-Shoham, Itzhaki, Yunger, Markel, Schachter and Besser.},

	abstract = {Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with T cells targeting neoantigens can mediate durable responses in patients with metastatic cancer. Cell therapies targeting common shared antigens for epithelial cancers are not yet broadly available. Here, we report the identification and characterization in one patient of T-cell receptors (TCRs) recognizing mutated p53 p.R175H, which is shared among a subset of patients with cancer. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were screened for recognition of mutated neoantigens in a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer. HLA-A0201–restricted recognition of mutated p53 p.R175H was identified, and the minimal peptide epitope was HMTEVVRHC. Reactive T cells were isolated by tetramer sorting, and three TCRs were identified. These TCRs mediated recognition of commercially available ovarian cancer, uterine carcinoma, and myeloma cell lines, as well as an NIH patient–derived esophageal adenocarcinoma line that endogenously expressed p53 p.R175H and HLA-A0201. They also mediated recognition of p53 p.R175Hþ colon, breast, and leukemia cell lines after transduction with a retrovirus encoding HLA-A0201. This work demonstrates that common shared mutated epitopes such as those found in p53 can elicit immunogenic responses and that the application of ACT may be extended to patients with any cancer histology that expresses both HLA-A0201 and the p53 p.R175H mutation. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.},

Among 81 candidate antigens tested, we identify T cells restricted to two known neoantigens simultaneously in tumours, spleens and lymph nodes in tumour-bearing mice. High-dimensional phenotypic profiling reveals that antigen-specific, tumour-infiltrating T cells are highly heterogeneous. We further show that neoantigen-specific T cells display a different phenotypic profile in mice treated with anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, whereas their peripheral counterparts are not affected by the treatments.

	abstract = {Adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) is a highly intensive immunotherapy regime that has yielded remarkable response rates and many durable responses in clinical trials in melanoma; however, 50-60% of the patients have no clinical benefit. Here, we searched for predictive biomarkers to ACT in melanoma. Whole exome-and transcriptome sequencing and neoantigen prediction were applied to pre-treatment samples from 27 patients recruited to a clinical phase I/II trial of ACT in stage IV melanoma. All patients had previously progressed on other immunotherapies. We report that clinical benefit is associated with significantly higher predicted neoantigen load. High mutation and predicted neoantigen load are significantly associated with improved progression-free and overall survival. Further, clinical benefit is associated with the expression of immune activation signatures including a high MHC-I antigen processing and presentation score. These results improve our understanding of mechanisms behind clinical benefit of ACT in melanoma. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The development of immunological therapies that incorporate peptide antigens presented to T cells by MHC proteins is a long sought-after goal, particularly for cancer, where mutated neoantigens are being explored as personalized cancer vaccines. Although neoantigens can be identified through sequencing, bioinformatics and mass spectrometry, identifying those which are immunogenic and able to promote tumor rejection remains a significant challenge. Here we examined the potential of high-resolution structural modeling followed by energetic scoring of structural features for predicting neoantigen immunogenicity. After developing a strategy to rapidly and accurately model nonameric peptides bound to the common class I MHC protein HLA-A2, we trained a neural network on structural features that influence T cell receptor (TCR) and peptide binding energies. The resulting structurally-parameterized neural network outperformed methods that do not incorporate explicit structural or energetic properties in predicting CD8+ T cell responses of HLA-A2 presented nonameric peptides, while also providing insight into the underlying structural and biophysical mechanisms governing immunogenicity. Our proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential for structure-based immunogenicity predictions in the development of personalized peptide-based vaccines. © 2019 Riley, Keller, Smith, Davancaze, Arbuiso, Devlin and Baker.},

	abstract = {Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) targeting neoantigens can mediate tumor regression in selected patients with metastatic epithelial cancer. However, effectively identifying and harnessing neoantigen-reactive T cells for patient treatment remains a challenge and it is unknown whether current methods to detect neoantigen-reactive T cells are missing potentially clinically relevant neoantigen reactivities. We thus investigated whether the detection of neoantigen-reactive TILs could be enhanced by enriching T cells that express PD-1 and/or T cell activation markers followed by microwell culturing to avoid overgrowth of nonreactive T cells. In 6 patients with metastatic epithelial cancer, this method led to the detection of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells targeting 18 and 1 neoantigens, respectively, compared with 6 and 2 neoantigens recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively, when using our standard TIL fragment screening approach. In 2 patients, no recognition of mutated peptides was observed using our conventional screen, while our high-throughput approach led to the identification of 5 neoantigen-reactive T cell receptors (TCRs) against 5 different mutations from one patient and a highly potent MHC class II-restricted KRASG12V-reactive TCR from a second patient. In addition, in a metastatic tumor sample from a patient with serous ovarian cancer, we isolated 3 MHC class II-restricted TCRs targeting the TP53G245S hot-spot mutation. In conclusion, this approach provides a highly sensitive platform to isolate clinically relevant neoantigen-reactive T cells or their TCRs for cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {The TP53 gene, encoding the critical p53 tumor suppressor, is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer. Intratumoral T cell responses to mutations occurring frequently at certain TP53 positions, termed hot spots, have not been systematically studied. The 8 most commonly mutated positions in TP53 were found in 33 (24%) of 140 common epithelial tumors analyzed. A TP53-specific screening assay was developed to evaluate T cell responses to these p53 neoepitopes presented though intracellular (tandem minigene) and extracellular (pulsed peptide) pathways on autologous antigen-presenting cells expressing all human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II molecules. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from 11 patients recognized autologous p53 neoantigens, which accounted for 8% and 39% of all patients sequenced (n = 140) and screened (n = 28), respectively. These responses were restricted by a variety of HLA restriction elements, including common class I (A*02:01) and class II (DPB1*02:01 and DRB1*13:01) alleles. T cell receptors (TCRs) were identified from TP53 mutation–reactive helper (CD4) and cytotoxic (CD8) T cells, and TIL and TCR gene–engineered T cells recognized tumor cell lines endogenously expressing HLA and mutant TP53. Thus, the most commonly mutated gene in cancer, TP53, appears to be immunogenic and represents an attractive candidate for evaluating targeted immune cancer therapies.

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitor induces tumor rejection by activated host immune system. The anti-tumor immune response consists of capture, presentation, recognition of neoantigen, as well as subsequent killing of tumor cell. Due to the interdependence among this series of stepwise events, neoantigen profoundly influences the efficacy of anti-immune checkpoint therapy. Moreover, the neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity is the cornerstone of multiple immunotherapies. In fact, several strategies targeting neoantigen have been attempted for synergetic effect with immune checkpoint inhibitor. Increasing neoantigen presentation to immune system by oncolytic virus, radiotherapy, or cancer vaccine is feasible to enhance neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity in theory. However, some obstacles have not been overcome in practice such as dynamic variation of neoantigen landscape, identification of potential neoantigen, maintenance of high T cell titer post vaccination. In addition, adoptive T cell transfer is another approach to enhance neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity, especially for patients with severe immunosuppression. In this review, we highlighted the advancements of neoantigen and innovative explorations of utilization of neoantigen repertoire in immune checkpoint blockade therapy. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Runaway mutations cause tumors, some of the non-synonymous mutational (i.e., missense, frameshift, fusion) peptides are degraded into short peptides by proteasome, then APCs (antigen-presenting cells) recognize and present them to draining lymph nodes. These short peptides, in line with the combination of MHC (major histocompatibility complex) motif, are captured by the T cell surface factors and produce an immune response, eventually lead to tumor regression. We call these peptides neoantigens, because these antigens are not negatively screened by thymus gland, they are recognized as "alien" by T cells and are not susceptible to immune tolerance mechanism. Neoantigens can act as effective targets for immune-mediated tumor control. The next generation sequencing technology greatly boosts the feasibility of neoantigen vaccine design, however identifying tumor somatic mutations that can be presented and recognized by TCR (T-cell receptor) is a very demanding yet key step. Many of the predicted "positive" neoantigen peptides are actually "false" and need to be eliminated in further steps to clinical application. Therefore effective screening method is an indispensable part of neoantigen vaccine therapy. However, no related reports have been seen in domestic. In this paper, the computational prediction process of screening methods for potential neoantigen peptides are reviewed. © 2019 Institute of Biophysics,Chinese Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are an ideal immunotherapy target due to their high mutation burden and frequent infiltration with lymphocytes. Preclinical models to investigate targeted and combination therapies as well as defining biomarkers to guide treatment represent an important need in the field. Immunogenomics approaches have illuminated the role of mutation-derived tumor neoantigens as potential biomarkers of response to checkpoint blockade as well as representing therapeutic vaccines. Here, we aimed to define a platform for checkpoint and other immunotherapy studies using syngeneic HNSCC cell line models (MOC2 and MOC22), and evaluated the association between mutation burden, predicted neoantigen landscape, infiltrating T cell populations and responsiveness of tumors to anti-PD1 therapy. We defined dramatic hematopoietic cell transcriptomic alterations in the MOC22 anti-PD1 responsive model in both tumor and draining lymph nodes. Using a cancer immunogenomics pipeline and validation with ELISPOT and tetramer analysis, we identified the H-2Kb-restricted ICAM1P315L (mICAM1) as a neoantigen in MOC22. Finally, we demonstrated that mICAM1 vaccination was able to protect against MOC22 tumor development defining mICAM1 as a bona fide neoantigen. Together these data define a pre-clinical HNSCC model system that provides a foundation for future investigations into combination and novel therapeutics. © Zolkind et al.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a lethal cancer with fewer than 7% of patients surviving past 5 years. T-cell immunity has been linked to the exceptional outcome of the few long-term survivors, yet the relevant antigens remain unknown. Here we use genetic, immunohistochemical and transcriptional immunoprofiling, computational biophysics, and functional assays to identify T-cell antigens in long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer. Using whole-exome sequencing and in silico neoantigen prediction, we found that tumours with both the highest neoantigen number and the most abundant CD8 + T-cell infiltrates, but neither alone, stratified patients with the longest survival. Investigating the specific neoantigen qualities promoting T-cell activation in long-term survivors, we discovered that these individuals were enriched in neoantigen qualities defined by a fitness model, and neoantigens in the tumour antigen MUC16 (also known as CA125). A neoantigen quality fitness model conferring greater immunogenicity to neoantigens with differential presentation and homology to infectious disease-derived peptides identified long-term survivors in two independent datasets, whereas a neoantigen quantity model ascribing greater immunogenicity to increasing neoantigen number alone did not. We detected intratumoural and lasting circulating T-cell reactivity to both high-quality and MUC16 neoantigens in long-term survivors of pancreatic cancer, including clones with specificity to both high-quality neoantigens and predicted cross-reactive microbial epitopes, consistent with neoantigen molecular mimicry. Notably, we observed selective loss of high-quality and MUC16 neoantigenic clones on metastatic progression, suggesting neoantigen immunoediting. Our results identify neoantigens with unique qualities as T-cell targets in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. More broadly, we identify neoantigen quality as a biomarker for immunogenic tumours that may guide the application of immunotherapies. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

This pipeline was beneficial to the biologist with little programmatic background.

	abstract = {Recent efforts to design personalized cancer immunotherapies use predicted neoantigens, but most neoantigen prediction strategies do not consider proximal (nearby) variants that alter the peptide sequence and may influence neoantigen binding. We evaluated somatic variants from 430 tumors to understand how proximal somatic and germline alterations change the neoantigenic peptide sequence and also affect neoantigen binding predictions. On average, 241 missense somatic variants were analyzed per sample. Of these somatic variants, 5% had one or more in-phase missense proximal variants. Without incorporating proximal variant correction for major histocompatibility complex class I neoantigen peptides, the overall false discovery rate (incorrect neoantigens predicted) and the false negative rate (strong-binding neoantigens missed) across peptides of lengths 8–11 were estimated as 0.069 (6.9%) and 0.026 (2.6%), respectively. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.},

	abstract = {Effective anti-Tumour immunity in humans has been associated with the presence of T cells directed at cancer neoantigens, a class of HLA-bound peptides that arise from tumour-specific mutations. They are highly immunogenic because they are not present in normal tissues and hence bypass central thymic tolerance. Although neoantigens were long-envisioned as optimal targets for an anti-Tumour immune response, their systematic discovery and evaluation only became feasible with the recent availability of massively parallel sequencing for detection of all coding mutations within tumours, and of machine learning approaches to reliably predict those mutated peptides with high-Affinity binding of autologous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. We hypothesized that vaccination with neoantigens can both expand pre-existing neoantigen-specific T-cell populations and induce a broader repertoire of new T-cell specificities in cancer patients, tipping the intra-Tumoural balance in favour of enhanced tumour control. Here we demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity of a vaccine that targets up to 20 predicted personal tumour neoantigens. Vaccine-induced polyfunctional CD4 + and CD8 + T cells targeted 58 (60%) and 15 (16%) of the 97 unique neoantigens used across patients, respectively. These T cells discriminated mutated from wild-Type antigens, and in some cases directly recognized autologous tumour. Of six vaccinated patients, four had no recurrence at 25 months after vaccination, while two with recurrent disease were subsequently treated with anti-PD-1 (anti-programmed cell death-1) therapy and experienced complete tumour regression, with expansion of the repertoire of neoantigen-specific T cells. These data provide a strong rationale for further development of this approach, alone and in combination with checkpoint blockade or other immunotherapies. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

	abstract = {Background: Mutant peptides presented by MHC (major histocompatibility complex) Class II in cancer are important targets for cancer immunotherapy. Both animal studies and clinical trials in cancer patients showed that CD4 T cells specific to tumor-derived mutant peptides are essential for the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy by PD1 antibody. Results: In this study, we analyzed the next generation sequencing data of 147 lung adenocarcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas and predicted neoantigens presented by MHC Class I and Class II molecules. We found 18,175 expressed clonal somatic mutations, with an average of 124 per patient. The presentation of mutant peptides by an HLA(human leukocyte antigen) Class II molecule, HLA DRB1, were predicted by NetMHCIIpan3.1. 8804 neo-peptides, including 375 strong binders and 8429 weak binders were found. For HLA DRB1*01:01, 54 strong binders and 896 weak binders were found. The most commonly mutated genes with predicted neo-antigens are KRAS, TTN, RYR2, MUC16, TP53, USH2A, ZFHX4, KEAP1, STK11, FAT3, NAV3 and EGFR. Conclusions: Our results support the feasibility of discovering individualized HLA Class II presented mutant peptides as candidates for immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy of lung adenocarcinoma. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Cancer neoantigens derived from random somatic mutations in tumor tissue represent an attractive type of targets for the cancer immunotherapies including cancer vaccine. Vaccination against the tumor-specific neoantigens minimizes the potential induction of central and peripheral tolerance as well as the risk of autoimmunity. Neoantigen-based cancer vaccines have recently showed marked therapeutic potential in both preclinical and early-phase clinical studies. However, significant challenges remain in the effective and faithful identification of immunogenic neoepitopes and the efficient and safe delivery of the subunit vaccine components for eliciting potent and robust anticancer T cell responses. In this mini review, we provide a brief overview of the recent advances in the development of neoantigen-based cancer vaccines focusing on various vaccine delivery strategies for targeting and modulating antigen-presenting cells.

	abstract = {                             To develop a practically applicable method for T-cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cell immunotherapy targeting neoantigens, we have been attempting to identify neoantigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) and establish TCR-engineered T cells in a 3–4-month period. In this study, we report the characterization of T cell repertoires in tumor microenvironment (TME) and identification of neoantigen-specific TCRs after stimulation of patient-derived T cells. We screened 15 potential neoantigen peptides and successfully identified two CD8                             +                             HLA-dextramer                             +                              T cells, which recognized MAGOHB                             G17A                              and ZCCHC14                             P368L                             . All three dominant TCR clonotypes from MAGOHB                             G17A                             -HLA dextramer-sorted CD8                             +                              T cells were also found in T cells in TME, while none of dominant TCR clonotypes from ZCCHC14                             P368L                             -HLA dextramer-sorted CD8                             +                              T cells was found in the corresponding TME. The most dominant TCRA/TCRB pairs for these two neoantigens were cloned into HLA-matched healthy donors’ T lymphocytes to generate TCR-engineered T cells. The functional assay showed MAGOHB                             G17A                              TCR-engineered T cells could be significantly activated in a mutation-specific, HLA-restricted and peptide-dose-dependent manner while ZCCHC14                             P368L                              TCR-engineered T cells could not.

	abstract = {Background: Patients with highly mutated tumors, such as melanoma or smoking-related lung cancer, have higher rates of response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy, perhaps due to increased neoantigen expression. Many chemotherapies including platinum compounds are known to be mutagenic, but the impact of standard treatment protocols on mutational burden and resulting neoantigen expression in most human cancers is unknown. Methods: We sought to quantify the effect of chemotherapy treatment on computationally predicted neoantigen expression for high grade serous ovarian carcinoma patients enrolled in the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study. In this series, 35 of 114 samples were collected after exposure to chemotherapy; 14 are matched with an untreated sample from the same patient. Our approach integrates whole genome and RNA sequencing of bulk tumor samples with class I MHC binding prediction and mutational signatures extracted from studies of chemotherapy-exposed Caenorhabditis elegans and Gallus gallus cells. We additionally investigated the relationship between neoantigens, tumor infiltrating immune cells estimated from RNA-seq with CIBERSORT, and patient survival. Results: Greater neoantigen burden and CD8+ T cell infiltration in primary, pre-treatment samples were independently associated with improved survival. Relapse samples collected after chemotherapy harbored a median of 78% more expressed neoantigens than untreated primary samples, a figure that combines the effects of chemotherapy and other processes operative during relapse. The contribution from chemotherapy-associated signatures was small, accounting for a mean of 5% (range 0-16) of the expressed neoantigen burden in relapse samples. In both treated and untreated samples, most neoantigens were attributed to COSMIC Signature (3), associated with BRCA disruption, Signature (1), associated with a slow mutagenic process active in healthy tissue, and Signature (8), of unknown etiology. Conclusion: Relapsed ovarian cancers harbor more predicted neoantigens than primary tumors, but the increase is due to pre-existing mutational processes, not mutagenesis from chemotherapy. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {                             T-cell recognition of cancer neoantigens is important for effective immune-checkpoint blockade therapy, and an increasing interest exists in developing personalized tumor neoantigen vaccines. Previous studies utilizing RNA and long-peptide neoantigen vaccines in preclinical and early-phase clinical studies have shown immune responses predominantly driven by MHC class II CD4                             þ                              T cells. Here, we report on a preclinical study utilizing a DNA vaccine platform to target tumor neoantigens. We showed that optimized strings of tumor neoantigens, when delivered by potent electroporation-mediated DNA delivery, were immunogenic and generated predominantly MHC class I-restricted, CD8                             þ                              T-cell responses.

These DNA neoantigen vaccines induced a therapeutic antitumor response in vivo, and neoantigen-specific T cells expanded from immunized mice directly killed tumor cells ex vivo. These data illustrate a unique advantage of this DNA platform to drive CD8                             þ                              T-cell immunity for neoantigen immunotherapy.                          © 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Background: Personalized cancer vaccines based on neoantigens have reached the clinical trial stage in melanoma. Different vaccination protocols showed efficacy in preclinical models without a clear indication of the quality and the number of neoantigens required for an effective cancer vaccine. Methods: In an effort to develop potent and efficacious neoantigen-based vaccines, we have developed different neoantigen minigene (NAM) vaccine vectors to determine the rules for a successful neoantigen cancer vaccine (NCV) delivered by plasmid DNA and electroporation. Immune responses were analyzed at the level of single neoantigen by flow cytometry and correlated with tumor growth. Adoptive T cell transfer, from HLA-2.1.1 mice, was used to demonstrate the efficacy of the NCV pipeline against human-derived tumors. Results: In agreement with previous bodies of evidence, immunogenicity was driven by predicted affinity. A strong poly-functional and poly-specific immune response was observed with high affinity neoantigens. However, only a high poly-specific vaccine vector was able to completely protect mice from subsequent tumor challenge. More importantly, this pipeline - from the selection of neoantigens to vaccine design - applied to a new model of patient derived tumor xenograft resulted in therapeutic treatment. Conclusions: These results suggest a feasible strategy for a neoantigen cancer vaccine that is simple and applicable for clinical developments. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Next generation sequencing has yielded an unparalleled means of quickly determining the molecular make-up of patient tumors. In conjunction with emerging, effective immunotherapeutics for a number of cancers, this rapid data generation necessitates a paired high-throughput means of predicting and assessing neoantigens from tumor variants that may stimulate immune response. Results: Here we offer NeoPredPipe (Neoantigen Prediction Pipeline) as a contiguous means of predicting putative neoantigens and their corresponding recognition potentials for both single and multi-region tumor samples. NeoPredPipe is able to quickly provide summary information for researchers, and clinicians alike, on predicted neoantigen burdens while providing high-level insights into tumor heterogeneity given somatic mutation calls and, optionally, patient HLA haplotypes. Given an example dataset we show how NeoPredPipe is able to rapidly provide insights into neoantigen heterogeneity, burden, and immune stimulation potential. Conclusions: Through the integration of widely adopted tools for neoantigen discovery NeoPredPipe offers a contiguous means of processing single and multi-region sequence data.

MHC class II restricted neoantigen has the potential to be a promising target of tumor immunotherapy, although the limited comprehension and technical difficulties need to be overcome before being applied into clinical practice. This review discussed the immunologic mechanism, screening technique, clinical application, limitations and prospectives of MHC class II restricted neoantigens in tumor immunotherapy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The self-immunopeptidome is the repertoire of all self-peptides that can be presented by the combination of MHC variants carried by an individual, defined by their HLA genotype. Each MHC variant presents a distinct set of self-peptides, and the number of peptides in a set is variable. Subjects carrying MHC variants that present fewer self-peptides should also present fewer mutated peptides, resulting in decreased immune pressure on tumor cells. To explore this, we predicted peptide-MHC binding values using all unique 8-11mer human peptides in the human proteome and all available HLA class I allelic variants, for a total of 134 billion unique peptide--MHC binding predictions. From these predictions, we observe that most peptides are able to be presented by relatively few (< 250) MHC, while some can be presented by upwards of 1,500 different MHC. There is substantial overlap among the repertoires of peptides presented by different MHC and no relationship between the number of peptides presented and HLA population frequency. Nearly 30% of self-peptides are presentable by at least one MHC, leaving 70% of the human peptidome unsurveyed by T cells. We observed similar distributions of predicted self-immunopeptidome sizes in cancer subjects compared to controls, and within the pan-cancer population, predicted self-immunopeptidome size combined with mutational load to predict survival. Self-immunopeptidome analysis revealed evidence for tumor immunoediting and identified specific peptide positions that most influence immunogenicity. Because self-immunopeptidome size is defined by HLA genotypes and approximates neoantigen load, HLA genotyping could offer a rapid predictive biomarker for response to immunotherapy. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Neoantigens, which are expressed on tumor cells, are one of the main targets of an effective antitumor T-cell response. Cancer immunotherapies to target neoantigens are of growing interest and are in early human trials, but methods to identify neoantigens either require invasive or difficult-to-obtain clinical specimens, require the screening of hundreds to thousands of synthetic peptides or tandem minigenes, or are only relevant to specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We apply deep learning to a large (N = 74 patients) HLA peptide and genomic dataset from various human tumors to create a computational model of antigen presentation for neoantigen prediction. We show that our model, named EDGE, increases the positive predictive value of HLA antigen prediction by up to ninefold. We apply EDGE to enable identification of neoantigens and neoantigen-reactive T cells using routine clinical specimens and small numbers of synthetic peptides for most common HLA alleles. EDGE could enable an improved ability to develop neoantigen-targeted immunotherapies for cancer patients. © 2019, Nature Publishing Group. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the tumor-specific neoantigen for primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL) using gene sequencing technology combined with bioinformatic analysis. Methods: Peripheral blood samples of one patient with primary PCL during relapse and remission periods were collected. HLA molecular typing was performed using polymerase chain reaction with sequencing-based typing; whole-exome and transcriptome were sequenced by next-generation sequencing method; and bioinformatics software NetMHC-pan was used to predict neoantigens. Results: Six tumor-specific missense mutations were found in the patient's peripheral blood during relapse period, located in genes FRG1, MLL3, SVIL, MYOM1, ZDHHC11 and RFPL4A.Considering patient's HLA sub-types, 43 neoantigens were predicted via bioinformatics. Considering that FRG1 and MLL3 had relatively high gene expression levels, 20 neoantigens derived from mutations of the two genes were preferentially selected, among which four neoantigens had high affinity with the patient's HLA molecules and thus had potential clinical application value. Conclusion: The study has completed a tumor neoantigen screen and prediction for primary PCL. This practice demonstrates that predicting neoantigen based on tumor-specific somatic mutation is feasible for primary PCL. © 2019, Editorial office of Chinese Journal of Cancer Biotherapy.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND. Recent genomic and bioinformatic technological advances have made it possible to dissect the immune response to personalized neoantigens encoded by tumor-specific mutations. However, timely and efficient identification of neoantigens is still a major obstacle to personalized neoantigen-based cancer immunotherapy. METHODS. Two different pipelines of neoantigen identification were established in this study: (a) Clinical-grade targeted sequencing was performed in patients with refractory solid tumor, and mutant peptides with high variant allele frequency and predicted high HLA-binding affinity were synthesized de novo. (b) An inventory-shared neoantigen peptide library of common solid tumors was constructed, and patients’ hotspot mutations were matched to the neoantigen peptide library. The candidate neoepitopes were identified by recalling memory T cell responses in vitro. Subsequently, neoantigen-loaded dendritic cell vaccines and neoantigen-reactive T cells were generated for personalized immunotherapy in 6 patients. RESULTS. Immunogenic neoepitopes were recognized by autologous T cells in 3 of 4 patients who used the de novo synthesis mode and in 6 of 13 patients who used the shared neoantigen peptide library. A metastatic thymoma patient achieved a complete and durable response beyond 29 months after treatment. Immune-related partial response was observed in another patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The remaining 4 patients achieved prolonged stabilization of disease with a median progression-free survival of 8.6 months. CONCLUSION. The current study provides feasible pipelines for neoantigen identification. Implementing these strategies to individually tailor neoantigens could facilitate neoantigen-based translational immunotherapy research.

	abstract = {Checkpoint blockade immunotherapies enable the host immune system to recognize and destroy tumour cells. Their clinical activity has been correlated with activated T-cell recognition of neoantigens, which are tumour-specific, mutated peptides presented on the surface of cancer cells. Here we present a fitness model for tumours based on immune interactions of neoantigens that predicts response to immunotherapy. Two main factors determine neoantigen fitness: The likelihood of neoantigen presentation by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and subsequent recognition by T cells. We estimate these components using the relative MHC binding affinity of each neoantigen to its wild type and a nonlinear dependence on sequence similarity of neoantigens to known antigens. To describe the evolution of a heterogeneous tumour, we evaluate its fitness as a weighted effect of dominant neoantigens in the subclones of the tumour. Our model predicts survival in anti-CTLA-4-treated patients with melanoma and anti-PD-1-treated patients with lung cancer. Importantly, low-fitness neoantigens identified by our method may be leveraged for developing novel immunotherapies. By using an immune fitness model to study immunotherapy, we reveal broad similarities between the evolution of tumours and rapidly evolving pathogens. © 2017 Author.},

	abstract = {The median overall survival for children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is less than one year. The majority of diffuse midline gliomas, including more than 70% of DIPGs, harbor an amino acid substitution from lysine (K) to methionine (M) at position 27 of histone 3 variant 3 (H3.3). From a CD8+ T cell clone established by stimulation of HLA-A2+ CD8+ T cells with synthetic peptide encompassing the H3.3K27M mutation, complementary DNA for T cell receptor (TCR ) α- and β-chains were cloned into a retroviral vector. TCR -transduced HLA-A2+ T cells efficiently killed HLA-A2+H3.3K27M+ glioma cells in an antigen- and HLA-specific manner. Adoptive transfer of TCR -transduced T cells significantly suppressed the progression of glioma xenografts in mice. Alanine-scanning assays suggested the absence of known human proteins sharing the key amino acid residues required for recognition by the TCR, suggesting that the TCR could be safely used in patients. These data provide us with a strong basis for developing T cell-based therapy targeting this shared neoepitope. © 2018 Chheda et al.},

	abstract = {Genetic instability of tumor cells often leads to the occurrence of a large number of mutations, and expression of non-synonymous mutations can produce tumor-specific antigens called neoantigens. Neoantigens are highly immunogenic as they are not expressed in normal tissues. They can activate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to generate immune response and have the potential to become new targets of tumor immunotherapy. The development of bioinformatics technology has accelerated the identification of neoantigens. The combination of different algorithms to identify and predict the affinity of neoantigens to major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) or the immunogenicity of neoantigens is mainly based on the whole-exome sequencing technology. Tumor vaccines targeting neoantigens mainly include nucleic acid, dendritic cell (DC)-based, tumor cell, and synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccines. The combination with immune checkpoint inhibition therapy or radiotherapy and chemotherapy might achieve better therapeutic effects. Currently, several clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of these vaccines. Further development of sequencing technologies and bioinformatics algorithms, as well as an improvement in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying tumor development, will expand the application of neoantigen vaccines in the future. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Activating the immune system to fight against cancers has long been a goal in immunology and oncology studies. Recent clinical-trial data proved that boosting the activity of endogenous T cells to destroy cancer cells has great potential in controlling the progression of a variety of human malignancies. In essence, neoantigen is at the core of tumor immunology. Autologous T lymphocytes could distinguish tumor cells from normal cells by recognizing neoantigens, which are tumor specific. Neoantigens are derived from genome somatic mutations of tumors, and there are different approaches to predict and identify them with increasing accuracy. Neoantigens are tumor specific, which are ideal and attractive targets for tumor immunotherapies; many neoantigen-based clinical trials are being carried out around the world. In this review, we will discuss the recent advances of tumor neoantigen vaccine immunotherapy, and present the potential obstacle and future direction of this approach. . © 2019 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

	abstract = {Mutation-associated neoantigens (MANA) are a target of antitumor T-cell immunity. Sensitive, simple, and standardized assays are needed to assess the repertoire of functional MANA-specific T cells in oncology. Assays analyzing in vitro cytokine production such as ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining have been useful but have limited sensitivity in assessing tumor-specific T-cell responses and do not analyze antigen-specific T-cell repertoires. The FEST (Functional Expansion of Specific T cells) assay described herein integrates T-cell receptor sequencing of short-term, peptide-stimulated cultures with a bioinformatic platform to identify antigen-specific clonotypic amplifications. This assay can be adapted for all types of antigens, including MANAs via tumor exome-guided prediction of MANAs. Following in vitro identification by the MANAFEST assay, the MANA-specific CDR3 sequence can be used as a molecular barcode to detect and monitor the dynamics of these clonotypes in blood, tumor, and normal tissue of patients receiving immunotherapy. MANAFEST is compatible with high-throughput routine clinical and lab practices. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Current evolution of cancer immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint blockade, has implicated neoantigens as major targets of anticancer cytotoxic T cells. Adoptive T-cell therapy with neoantigen-specific T-cell receptor (TCR)- engineered T cells would be an attractive therapeutic option for advanced cancers where the host antitumor immune function is strongly inhibited. We previously developed a rapid and efficient pipeline for production of neoantigen-specific TCR-engineered T cells using peripheral blood from an HLA-matched healthy donor. Our protocol required only 2 weeks from stimulation of T cells with neoantigen-loaded dendritic cells to the identification of neoantigen-specific TCRs. We conducted the pilot study to validate our protocol. Experimental Design: We used tumors from 7 ovarian cancer patients to validate our protocol. Results: We chose 14 candidate neoantigens from 7 ovarian tumors (1-3 candidates for each patient) and then successfully induced three neoantigen-specific T cells from 1 healthy donor and identified their TCR sequences. Moreover, we validated functional activity of the three identified TCRs by generating TCR-engineered T cells that recognized the corresponding neoantigens and showed cytotoxic activity in an antigen dose-dependent manner. However, one case of neoantigen-specific TCR-engineered T cells showed cross-reactivity against the corresponding wild-type peptide. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of our efficient process from identification of neoantigen to production of the neoantigen-targeting cytotoxic TCR-engineered T cells for ovarian cancer and revealed the importance of careful validation of neoantigen-specific TCR-engineered T cells to avoid severe immune-related adverse events. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {                             Genomic instability, which is a hallmark of cancer, is generally thought to occur in the middle to late stages of tumourigenesis, following the acquisition of permissive molecular aberrations such as TP53 mutation or whole genome doubling. Tumours with somatic POLE exonuclease domain mutations are notable for their extreme genomic instability (their mutation burden is among the highest in human cancer), distinct mutational signature, lymphocytic infiltrate, and excellent prognosis. To what extent these characteristics are determined by the timing of POLE mutations in oncogenesis is unknown. Here, we have shown that pathogenic POLE mutations are detectable in non-malignant precursors of endometrial and colorectal cancer. Using genome and exome sequencing, we found that multiple driver mutations in POLE-mutant cancers show the characteristic POLE mutational signature, including those in genes conventionally regarded as initiators of tumourigenesis. In POLE-mutant cancers, the proportion of monoclonal predicted neoantigens was similar to that in other cancers, but the absolute number was much greater. We also found that the prominent CD8                             +                              T-cell infiltrate present in POLE-mutant cancers was evident in their precursor lesions. Collectively, these data indicate that somatic POLE mutations are early, quite possibly initiating, events in the endometrial and colorectal cancers in which they occur. The resulting early onset of genomic instability may account for the striking immune response and excellent prognosis of these tumours, as well as their early presentation. © 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {Cancer arises from the accumulation of genetic alterations, which can lead to the production of mutant proteins not expressed by normal cells. These mutant proteins can be processed and presented on the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex molecules as neoepitopes, allowing CD8+ T cells to mount responses against them. For solid tumors, only an average 2% of neoepitopes predicted by algorithms have detectable endogenous antitumor T cell responses. This suggests that low mutation burden tumors, which include many pediatric tumors, are poorly immunogenic. Here, we report that pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have tumor-associated neoepitope-specific CD8+ T cells, responding to 86% of tested neoantigens and recognizing 68% of the tested neoepitopes. These responses include a public neoantigen from the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion that is targeted in seven of nine tested patients. We characterized phenotypic and transcriptional profiles of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) at the single-cell level and found a heterogeneous population that included highly functional effectors. Moreover, we observed immunodominance hierarchies among the CD8+ TILs restricted to one or two putative neoepitopes. Our results indicate that robust antitumor immune responses are induced in pediatric ALL despite their low mutation burdens and emphasize the importance of immunodominance in shaping cellular immune responses.

	abstract = {Peng et al. report a sensitive method to detect tumor-associated neoantigen-specific T cells. Neoantigens and fluorescent DNA barcodes, presented on nanoparticle scaffolds, permit multiplex capture and analysis of specific T cell populations from blood or tumor. Neoantigen-specific T cell numbers track tumor volume in a melanoma patient responding to immunotherapy. © 2019 The Author(s); Neoantigen-specific T cells are increasingly viewed as important immunotherapy effectors, but physically isolating these rare cell populations is challenging. Here, we describe a sensitive method for the enumeration and isolation of neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells from small samples of patient tumor or blood. The method relies on magnetic nanoparticles that present neoantigen-loaded major histocompatibility complex (MHC) tetramers at high avidity by barcoded DNA linkers. The magnetic particles provide a convenient handle to isolate the desired cell populations, and the barcoded DNA enables multiplexed analysis. The method exhibits superior recovery of antigen-specific T cell populations relative to literature approaches. We applied the method to profile neoantigen-specific T cell populations in the tumor and blood of patients with metastatic melanoma over the course of anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We show that the method has value for monitoring clinical responses to cancer immunotherapy and might help guide the development of personalized mutational neoantigen-specific T cell therapies and cancer vaccines. © 2019 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Neoantigens, which are derived from tumour-specific protein-coding mutations, are exempt from central tolerance, can generate robust immune responses1,2 and can function as bona fide antigens that facilitate tumour rejection3. Here we demonstrate that a strategy that uses multi-epitope, personalized neoantigen vaccination, which has previously been tested in patients with high-risk melanoma4–6, is feasible for tumours such as glioblastoma, which typically have a relatively low mutation load1,7 and an immunologically ‘cold’ tumour microenvironment8. We used personalized neoantigen-targeting vaccines to immunize patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma following surgical resection and conventional radiotherapy in a phase I/Ib study. Patients who did not receive dexamethasone—a highly potent corticosteroid that is frequently prescribed to treat cerebral oedema in patients with glioblastoma—generated circulating polyfunctional neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses that were enriched in a memory phenotype and showed an increase in the number of tumour-infiltrating T cells. Using single-cell T cell receptor analysis, we provide evidence that neoantigen-specific T cells from the peripheral blood can migrate into an intracranial glioblastoma tumour. Neoantigen-targeting vaccines thus have the potential to favourably alter the immune milieu of glioblastoma. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have enabled rapid and efficient evaluation of the mutational landscape of cancers. As a result, many cancer-specific neoantigens, which can generate antitumor cytotoxic T-cells inside tumors, have been identified. Previously, we reported a metastatic melanoma case with high tumor mutation burden, who obtained complete remission after anti-PD-1 therapy and surgical resection. The rib metastatic lesion, which was used for whole-exome sequencing and gene expression profiling in the HOPE project, showed upregulated expression of PD-L1 mRNA and a high single-nucleotide variants number of 2712. In the current study, we focused on a metastatic melanoma case and candidate epitopes among nonsynonymous mutant neoantigens of 1348 variants were investigated using a peptide-HLA binding algorithm, in vitro cytotoxic T-cell induction assay and HLA tetramer staining. Specifically, from mutant neoantigen data, a total of 21,066 9-mer mutant epitope candidates including a mutated amino acid anywhere in the sequence were applied to the NetMHC binding prediction algorithm. From in silico data, we identified the top 26 mutant epitopes with strong-binding capacity. A cytotoxic T-cell induction assay using 5 cancer patient-derived PBMCs revealed that the mutant ARMT1 peptide sequence (FYGKTILWF) with HLA-A*2402 restriction was an efficient neoantigen, which was detected at a frequency of approximately 0.04% in the HLA-A24 tetramer stain. The present success in identifying a novel mutant antigen epitope might be applied to clinical neoantigen screening in the context of an NGS-equipped medical facility for the development of the next-generation neoantigen cancer vaccines. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Genomic intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) may be associated with postsurgical relapse of localized lung adenocarcinomas. Recently, mutations, through generation of neoantigens, were shown to alter tumor immunogenicity through T-cell responses. Here, we performed sequencing of the T-cell receptor (TCR) in 45 tumor regions from 11 localized lung adenocarcinomas and observed substantial intratumor differences in T-cell density and clonality with the majority of T-cell clones restricted to individual tumor regions. TCR ITH positively correlated with predicted neoantigen ITH, suggesting that spatial differences in the T-cell repertoire may be driven by distinct neoantigens in different tumor regions. Finally, a higher degree of TCR ITH was associated with an increased risk of postsurgical relapse and shorter disease-free survival, suggesting a potential clinical significance of T-cell repertoire heterogeneity. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study provides insights into the ITH of the T-cell repertoire in localized lung adenocarcinomas and its potential biological and clinical impact. The results suggest that T-cell repertoire ITH may be tightly associated to genomic ITH and disease relapse. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Introduction. Personalized vaccine therapy that stimulates immune system to recognize mutant tumor neoantigens is one of the promising approaches of cancer treatment. Objective. Evaluation of immunogenicity and antitumor efficacy of synthetic neoantigen peptides and poly(I:C) adjuvant against murine melanoma B16F10. Materials and methods. 43 synthetic mutant neoantigen peptides selected earlier according to the bioinformatics analysis of the results of melanoma B16F10 sequencing were investigated. The study was performed in mice C57Bl/6J with subcutaneously transplanted melanoma B16F10 after double vaccination by peptide groups with or without adjuvant poly(I:C). Immunogenicity of peptides was evaluated by ELISPOT that detected the number of interferon-gamma producing cells. Antitumor activity was evaluated on the base of tumor growth inhibition and the increase of the survival rate. Results. The number of interferon-gamma producing cells increased after in vitro stimulation by the peptides of the model vaccine in the group of mice which had been vaccinated by these peptides with the adjuvant. The number of interferon-gamma producing cells in vitro did not change after addition of vaccine peptides or any other peptides in the groups of mice that had been vaccinated by the peptides without the adjuvant as compared to the control group. Double vaccination by the peptides with the adjuvant induced a potent antitumor effect in some cases, three of the eight groups of the peptides with the adjuvant induced significant inhibition of tumor growth and the increase of survival rate in mice. Conclusion. Thereby, it was shown that vaccination of mice by peptides in combination with adjuvant poly(I:C) stimulated the cell immunity response, however, the increase of the number of interferon-gamma producing cells is not an indicator of the antitumor efficacy of neoantigen peptides. © 2019, ABV-press Publishing House.

	abstract = {Molecular alterations in genes involved in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) promote cancer initiation and foster tumour progression1. Cancers deficient in MMR frequently show favourable prognosis and indolent progression2. The functional basis of the clinical outcome of patients with tumours that are deficient in MMR is not clear. Here we genetically inactivate MutL homologue 1 (MLH1) in colorectal, breast and pancreatic mouse cancer cells. The growth of MMR-deficient cells was comparable to their proficient counterparts in vitro and on transplantation in immunocompromised mice. By contrast, MMR-deficient cancer cells grew poorly when transplanted in syngeneic mice. The inactivation of MMR increased the mutational burden and led to dynamic mutational profiles, which resulted in the persistent renewal of neoantigens in vitro and in vivo, whereas MMR-proficient cells exhibited stable mutational load and neoantigen profiles over time. Immune surveillance improved when cancer cells, in which MLH1 had been inactivated, accumulated neoantigens for several generations. When restricted to a clonal population, the dynamic generation of neoantigens driven by MMR further increased immune surveillance. Inactivation of MMR, driven by acquired resistance to the clinical agent temozolomide, increased mutational load, promoted continuous renewal of neoantigens in human colorectal cancers and triggered immune surveillance in mouse models. These results suggest that targeting DNA repair processes can increase the burden of neoantigens in tumour cells; this has the potential to be exploited in therapeutic approaches. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Eighteen CRF subjects received two immunizations with phiX174 separated by 6 weeks. Nine subjects received a single dose of RIT. The intensity and immunoglobulin isotype of the antibody response (Kv) were measured post-infusion. In addition, three subjects previously immunized and treated with RIT underwent a third and fourth immunization with phiX174 and a tetanus control 2 years later. RIT significantly decreased peak Kv responses when compared to both historic non-CRF controls and to CRF subjects. CRF itself decreased peak Kv responses compared to non-CRF controls. Percent-ratio of anti-phage IgM to IgG was significantly decreased in RIT treated subjects. One of three subjects treated with RIT was found to have developed a partial B cell tolerance to phiX174 administration 2 years later. RIT decreases antibody production and isotype switching to neoantigens and might be useful to prevent antibody response to therapeutic drugs and to newly transplanted organs.},

In this study Eneo expression was followed during the plasmin degradation of crosslinked (XL) fibrin in vitro, utilizing double antibody radioimmunoassay. Eneo was progressively exposed as degradation proceeded and its expression was associated with the liberation of high molecular weight fragments from XL-fibrin, their degradation into fragments DD and E, and the partial degradation of fragment E itself. An isolated protein fraction containing early high molecular weight fragments (MW > 360000 d) and a fraction containing fragments YY and DY expressed approximately 170 times and 15 times less Eneo per protein respectively compared to the fragment E standard. XL-fibrin fragment E isolated from 1-hr plasmin digest expressed approximately 8 times less Eneo fragment E isolated from 24-hr digest, indicating increased exposure of Eneo during fragment E degradation. Eneo expression of this terminal fragment E was comparable to fibrinogen fragment E. As expected, fragment DD had no Eneo immunoreactivity.},

	abstract = {Summary.  Measurement of fibrinogen‐fibrin degradation products (FDP) levels in plasma may provide a direct index of plasmin action, and increased levels of FDP would indicate coagulopathy. We have established an E‐neoantigen radioimmunoassay (Eneo RIA) that can determine normal and pathological plasma levels of E‐related FDP. The assay employs rabbit antiserum produced against fragment E derived from a plasmin digest of fibrinogen and subsequently absorbed with fibrinogen. The absorbed antiserum contains antibodies which are equally reactive with fibrinogen derived E (Fg‐E) and fibrin derived E (Fb‐E) but not with fibrinogen at 1 mg/ml. The Eneo RIA was validated by assay parallelism and by recovery experiments. Plasma Eneo immunoreactivities in 14 normals were 4–22 ng/ml (mean 12.7 ng/ml). Plasma Eneo levels in 23 of 24 patients with neoplastic and haematological diseases were elevated above normal (range 27–2027 ng/ml). Unusually high Eneo values were observed with three patients whose diseases were complicated by either disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or deep vein thrombosis. After heparin therapy, the Eneo level of a patient with chronic DIC declined. A pathological plasma was eluted from a Sephadex G‐200 column and Eneo immunoreactivity was determined on the eluates. The gel filtration pattern of Eneo indicates that E‐related FDP is a family of plasmic fragments derived from crosslinked fibrin. Copyright © 1984, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD) is a major concern in blood transfusion. The P-Capt filter has been shown to remove around 4 log ID 50 prion infectivity from prion-spiked human red blood cells (RBCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two independent, single-center, randomized, open-label studies were designed to analyze the safety of P-Capt-filtered RBCs. RBCs prepared from leukoreduced whole blood from 43 eligible subjects were randomly assigned to P-Capt filtration and/or storage in plasma or SAGM and stored for 28 or 42 days. Stored RBCs were analyzed for in vivo 24-hour recovery, hemolysis, metabolic variables, blood group antigen expression, neoantigen formation, and safety after autologous infusion. RESULTS: Mean P-Capt filtration times for leukoreduced RBCs were 41 (SAGM) to 51 (plasma) minutes. Thirteen of 14 subjects receiving P-Capt-filtered RBCs had 24-hour RBC recoveries of 75% or more after 42-day storage, with a mean hemolysis of less than 0.6%. No loss of RBC antigen expression or formation of neoantigens was observed. In both studies, RBCs had white blood cell counts of less than 1 × 10 6/unit after leukofiltration. P-Capt prion filtration provided an additional greater than 0.8 log leukoreduction. No serious or unexpected adverse events were observed after infusion of P-Capt-filtered full-volume RBC units. CONCLUSIONS: P-Capt-filtered, stored RBCs demonstrated acceptable viability and no detectable neoantigen expression, immunogenic responses. or safety issues after infusion of a complete unit. The additional filtration time and modest reduction in RBC content are within acceptable levels for implementation in countries with transfusion transmission of vCJD. © 2011 American Association of Blood Banks.},

Of 29 patients with Stage A bladder cancer, 27 had positive tests, whereas of 11 patients with Stage B, C and D bladder cancer, 2 had positive tests. If the leukocytes from advanced bladder cancer patients were preincubated briefly with prostaglandin E2, the negative response was converted to positive. Of 189 patients with diseases of other organs, 2 had positive tests. Patients with acute or chronic cystitis had negative tests. The sensitivity of the assay was 88 per cent; specificity was 95 per cent. The bladder cancer extracts prepared from metastatic tissue or the tissue-cultured line, T24, had similar activity in the assay. Normal bladder tissue did not share the bladder cancer organ-specific neoantigen nor did cancers of other organs. Bladder epithelial cells expressed the OSN before they acquired invasive properties since patients with dysplastic bladder epithelium or in-situ cancer had positive tests. Antitumor immunity was often detectable before a recurrence became obvious by cystoscopy or cytology of urine and became undetectable quickly after removal of the bladder cancer. Of 100 patients with prior bladder cancer without evidence of ecphytic tumor, 18 had positive tests; the possibility must be considered seriously that some had precancerous changes which formed no visible gross abnormalities. The results suggested that antitumor immunity to bladder cancer was a sensitive indicator of precancerous or cancerous changes existing in epithelial cells.},

	abstract = {To explore the extent of immune reconstitution of SCID mice by human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hu-PBL-SCID mice), we studied the production of immunoglobulin isotypes and specific antibody (Ab) by the engrafted human cells. Human IgG was detectable in 94% of hu-PBL-SCID mice. IgE synthesis by hu-PBL-SCID mice correlated with the IgE levels observed in human donors. All SCID mice receiving PBL obtained from human donors previously immunized with the T-cell-dependent Ag, bacteriophage Φx 174 (phage), produced phage neutralizing antibody. Quantity and quality (Ig isotypes) of phage-specific Ab produced by hu-PBL-SCID mice correlated with that observed in the donor serum. Human B cells alone failed to engraft, and T cells were required for the production of Ig and anti-phage Ab. Phage-specific Ab production occurred without direct Ag exposure of the hu-PBL-SCID mice, suggesting that the specific Ab production was induced directly by polyclonal activation of the engrafted human cells. Intravenous phage injections given 4 wk after cell transfer failed to further increase the anti-phage Ab titer. Phage neutralizing Ab production could not be boosted if spleen cells obtained from hu-PBL-SCID mice were cultured in the presence of Ag. However, hu-PBL-SCID mice produced increased amounts of anti-phage Ab, providing they were injected with phage at the time of cell transfer. Injection of phage at the time of cell transfer, but not 4 wk later, to mice receiving PBL from nonimmunized donors induced production of minute amounts of anti-phage Ab. We conclude that human peripheral blood lymphocytes transferred into SCID mice become maximally stimulated presumably by xenogeneic murine Ag, resulting in polyclonal expansion of the graft and spontaneous production of Ab to Ag the human donor was previously exposed to, and in loss of responses to subsequent Ag exposure. Ab production to neoantigen, however, can be induced and that to recall Ag can be modified if PBL are exposed to Ag at the time of cell transfer.},

	abstract = {In this study, the metabolic activation of 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (hydrochlorofluorocarbons-123, HCFC-123), halothane or 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141b) was compared to that of perchloroethylene, using lymphoblastoma derived cell lines expressing human CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, CYP2A6 and CYP3A4 (MCL-5 cells). A dose dependent increase in micronucleus formation was detected over a nominal concentration range of 0.05-2 mM for HCFC-123 and halothane, but this was not seen with HCFC-141b. No dose response for HCFC-123 was seen in a control cHo1 cell line not expressing this cytochrome P450's. Cell lines expressing individual human cytochrome P-450 (CYP) forms were also used to define the enzymes responsible for the clastogenic events and to investigate the formation of immunoreactive protein by microsomal fractions. It was shown that CYP2E1 or CYP2B6 catalysed the clastogenic response, but CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP1A2 or CYP1A1 all appeared to be inactive. The formation of neoantigenic trifluoroacetylated protein adducts by microsomal mixtures incubated with HCFC-123 and NADPH was catalysed primarily by CYP2E1 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, whereas, only trace levels of immunoreactive protein were seen with microsomes expressing CYP2B6 or CYP2C8. With perchloroethylene as a substrate, the extent of activation was low in comparison with HCFC-123, as judged by the absence of micronuclei formation in the MCL-5 cell line and the weak immunoreactivity of proteins following Western blotting. CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 appeared to be responsible for perchloroethylene immunoreactivity and in contrast to the findings with the HCFC's, no activation of perchloroethylene by CYP2E1 could be detected. These results show that even though both saturated and unsaturated halocarbons can result in neoantigen formation, there is a marked difference in the specificity of the CYP enzymes involved in their metabolic activation. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate immune responses to neoantigen and recall antigens in healthy subjects treated with teriflunomide. Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects received oral teriflunomide (70 mg once daily for 5 days followed by 14 mg once daily for 25 days) or placebo for 30 days. Antibody responses were evaluated following rabies vaccination (neoantigen) applied at days 5, 12, and 31 of the treatment period. Occurrence of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to Candida albicans, Trichophyton, and tuberculin (recall antigens) was assessed before and at the end of treatment to investigate cellular memory response. Safety and pharmacokinetics were evaluated. Results: Forty-six randomized subjects were treated (teriflunomide, n 5 23; placebo, n 5 23) and completed the rabies vaccination. Geometric mean titers for rabies antibodies were lower with teriflunomide at days 31 and 38 than with placebo. However, all subjects achieved sufficient seroprotection following rabies vaccination (titers well above the 0.5 IU/mL threshold). Overall, the DTH response to recall antigens in the teriflunomide group did not notably differ from responses in the placebo group. Conclusions: Following vaccination, geometric mean titers for rabies antibodies were lower with teriflunomide than with placebo. However, teriflunomide did not limit the ability to achieve seroprotective titers against this neoantigen. Evaluation of DTH showed that teriflunomide had no adverse impact on the cellular memory response to recall antigens. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that in normal subjects treated with teriflunomide, antibody titer responses to rabies vaccination are lower than with placebo but sufficient for seroprotection. © 2015 American Academy of Neurology.},

	abstract = {To enhance the therapeutic index of allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (HSCT), we immunized 10 HLA-matched sibling donors before stem cell collection with recipient-derived clonal myeloma Ig, idiotype (Id), as a tumor antigen, conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Vaccinations were safe in donors and recipients. Donor-derived KLH- and Id-specific humoral and central and effector memory T-cell responses were detectable by day 30 after HSCT and were boosted by post-transplant vaccinations at 3 months in most recipients. One patient died before booster vaccinations. Specifically, after completing treatment, 8/9 myeloma recipients had persistent Id-specific immune responses and 5/9 had improvement in disease status. Although regulatory T cells increased after vaccination, they did not impact immune responses. At a median potential follow-up period of 74 months, 6 patients are alive, the 10 patients have a median PFS of 28.5 months and median OS has not been reached. Our results provide proof of principle that neoantigen and tumor antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity could be safely induced in HSCT donors and passively transferred to recipients. This general strategy may be used to reduce relapse of malignancies and augment protection against infections after allogeneic HSCT. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Until now, measurement of human antitumor immunity to organ-specific cancer neoantigen (OSN) by the leukocyte adherence inhibition (LAI) assay depended on using crude extracts of cancer. In this study, a new method is presented to generate and to isolate a highly enriched OSN from spent medium of a lung cancer cell line, NCI-H69, grown in chemically defined medium. Production of large quantities of OSN with minimal contamination by extraneous proteins was possible. Four physicochemical steps were used to give a 1000-fold enrichment of OSN activity: anion-exchange and molecular-sieve chromatography; Blue Sepharose affinity chromatography; and finally anion-exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography. The enriched OSN isolates showed dose-response antigenicity when tested in LAI assay with leukocytes from lung cancer patients but had no antigenicity with leukocytes from control subjects or patients having malignant melanoma, colon cancer, or pancreatic cancer. Cross-reactive antigenicity was observed with leukocytes from patients with breast cancer and slight reactivity with leukocytes from bladder cancer patients. The final isolate from the four-step separation procedure as well as the isolates produced using additional separation techniques consistently had antigenicity at <10 ng in blocking LAI and 500 ng in the direct assay and showed components with molecular weights of about 62,000 ± 3,000 (SD) (p62), 40,000 ± 3,000 (p40), and 25,000 ± 1,000 (p25) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The OSN isolates on two-dimensional gels showed p40 to have microheterogeneity (seven spots), with a pl from 6.2 to 7.6, and p62 and p25 as even more basic streaks. The polypeptide bearing the antigenic determinant was not purified, although we tried to separate p62, p40, and p25 to determine whether they carried the OSN determinant. The results of this study are important in showing that an isolate of an organ-specific tumor antigen containing 5 to 13 components, as determined by highly sensitive silver stains and radiolabeled patterns on single and two-dimensional gels, can be used successfully in LAI to measure tumor immune responses. © 1985, American Association for Cancer Research.

	abstract = {Cancer is caused by alterations to DNA that ultimately are translated into altered proteins with unique amino acid sequenceswhen compared with their counterparts in normal cells. By inference, these altered proteins have the potential to elicit immune responses such as T-cell recognition, if properly presented by the immune system following protein degradation and major histocompatibility complex binding. Historically, identifying tumor-specific mutant antigens was painstaking work that involved molecular cloning and immune screening. This scenario has changed dramatically in the last few years as new sequencing technology combined with computational data analysis can identify the unique tumor peptide sequences, and algorithmic evaluation of these novel peptides can estimate their binding affinity to the major histocompatibility complex haplotypes encoded by each genome. This process can identify unique neoantigens in each cancer, either as a means of characterizing the overall neoantigen load or as a precursor to designing a personalized cancer vaccine. An overview of the data and analysis methods used to identify cancer neoantigens will be presented along with an in-depth consideration of the nuances of each step. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

	abstract = {Adoptively transferred tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) that mediate complete regression of metastatic melanoma have been shown to recognize mutated epitopes expressed by autologous tumors. Here, in an attempt to develop a strategy for facilitating the isolation, expansion, and study of mutated antigen-specific T cells, we performed whole-exome sequencing on matched tumor and normal DNA isolated from 8 patients with metastatic melanoma. Candidate mutated epitopes were identified using a peptide-MHC-binding algorithm, and these epitopes were synthesized and used to generate panels of MHC tetramers that were evaluated for binding to tumor digests and cultured TILs used for the treatment of patients. This strategy resulted in the identification of 9 mutated epitopes from 5 of the 8 patients tested. Cells reactive with 8 of the 9 epitopes could be isolated from autologous peripheral blood, where they were detected at frequencies that were estimated to range between 0.4% and 0.002%. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of the successful isolation of mutation-reactive T cells from patients' peripheral blood prior to immune therapy, potentially providing the basis for designing personalized immunotherapies to treat patients with advanced cancer.},

	abstract = {Following interventional cardiology, thrombotic intracoronary stent occlusion represents a major side effect. We examined different stent sizes, and heparin-coated vs uncoated stents on their effect on platelet antigens CD62p, CD63, CD41a, and CD42b in an in vitro model. Stainless steel stents (each n=6; 10 mm size ± heparin), or tantalum stents (each n=15; 9 and 18 mm), respectively, were placed in one of three parallel silicon tubing systems (one control system without stent). After recalcification of PRP, samples were taken every 2 min (max 10 min) and analyzed by flow cytometry. After 10 min, the application of 18 mm stents resulted in a significantly higher platelet activation (PA) than the 9 mm size stents (CD62p: 56.2 ± 17.3 vs 45.2 ± 12.0 mean channel fluorescence intensity [MCFI], P<0.05; CD63: 49.6 ± 11.5 vs 39.7 ± 9.0 MCFI, P<0.05). Control tubings without stents showed no significant increase in PA. PA also ocurred in the tubing systems with coated and uncoated stents and was significant vs the control after 10 min (p<0.05). The difference in CD62p of coated vs uncoated stents was not significant at 10 min (CD62p: MCFI 52.5 ± 12.7; CD63: MCFI 50.3 ± 11.7; p=0.8). The expression of CD 63 showed similar results between the coated (MCFI 30.2 ± 3.2) and the uncoated stents (MCFI 29.4 ± 3.1). The time until thrombotic occlusion of the stents (TSO) in the three tubings differed from heparin-coated and uncoated stents vs control (each P<0.05). TSO was shortest in the tubing with the uncoated stent (12.5 min ± 2.4 min). The system with the heparin-coated stent showed the longest TSO (21.5 min ± 5.3 min; control system: 18.0 ± 4.2 min). Platelets become activated by the contact with artificial surfaces and shear forces of stents. The degree of activation is dependent on the size of the stent but not on coating with heparin. However, coating prolonged the TSO in our in vitro system. Therefore, local release of antithrombotic agents like heparin may be suitable for reducing thrombus formation in coronary angioplasty in vivo.},

	abstract = {Detection of lymphocytes that target tumor-specific mutant neoantigens - derived from products encoded by mutated genes in the tumor - is mostly limited to tumor-resident lymphocytes, but whether these lymphocytes often occur in the circulation is unclear. We recently reported that intratumoral expression of the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor can guide the identification of the patient-specific repertoire of tumor-reactive CD8+ lymphocytes that reside in the tumor. In view of these findings, we investigated whether PD-1 expression on peripheral blood lymphocytes could be used as a biomarker to detect T cells that target neoantigens. By using a high-throughput personalized screening approach, we identified neoantigen-specific lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of three of four melanoma patients. Despite their low frequency in the circulation, we found that CD8+ PD-1+, but not CD8+ PD-1 -, cell populations had lymphocytes that targeted 3, 3 and 1 unique, patient-specific neoantigens, respectively. We show that neoantigen-specific T cells and gene-engineered lymphocytes expressing neoantigen-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) isolated from peripheral blood recognized autologous tumors. Notably, the tumor-antigen specificities and TCR repertoires of the circulating and tumor-infiltrating CD8+ PD-1+ cells appeared similar, implying that the circulating CD8+ PD-1+ lymphocytes could provide a window into the tumor-resident antitumor lymphocytes. Thus, expression of PD-1 identifies a diverse and patient-specific antitumor T cell response in peripheral blood, providing a novel noninvasive strategy to develop personalized therapies using neoantigen-reactive lymphocytes or TCRs to treat cancer. © 2016 Nature America, Inc.

	abstract = {Immunotherapy approaches for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have met with limited success. It has been postulated that a low mutation load may lead to a paucity of T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, it is also possible that while neoantigens are present, an effective immune response cannot be generated due to an immune suppressive TME. To discern whether targetable neoantigens exist in PDAC, we performed a comprehensive study using genomic profiles of 221 PDAC cases extracted from public databases. Our findings reveal that: (a) nearly all PDAC samples harbor potentially targetable neoantigens; (b) T cells are present but generally show a reduced activation signature; and (c) markers of efficient antigen presentation are associated with a reduced signature of markers characterizing cytotoxic T cells. These findings suggest that despite the presence of tumor specific neoepitopes, T cell activation is actively suppressed in PDAC. Further, we identify iNOS as a potential mediator of immune suppression that might be actionable using pharmacological avenues. © 2016 The Author(s).},

We now describe a sensitive, specific, and reliable enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay for quantification of the TCC, based on monoclonal antibodies against a neoantigen of the complex. The results indicate that the TCC is present in normal human plasma and in increased amounts in patients with complement activation in vivo, thus confirming previously obtained results. The assay is easy to perform and can be used for examination of large numbers of plasma samples. Copyright © 1985, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

	abstract = {A monoclonal antibody to a neoantigen of the C9 portion of the membrane attack complex (MAC) of human complement has been developed and characterized. The distribution of this neoantigen was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy in nephritic and nonnephritic renal diseases. The antibody (Poly C9-MA) reacted on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a determinant in complement-activated serum that was undetectable in normal human serum (NHS). Zymosan particles incubated in NHS had positive immunofluorescent staining with Poly C9-MA; however, binding of Poly C9-MA was not observed with zymosan particles incubated in sera deficient in individual complement components C3, C5, C6, C7, C8, or C9. Reconstitution of C9-deficient sera with purified C9 restored the fluorescence with Poly C9-MA. Poly C9-MA reacted positively by ELISA in a dose-dependent manner with purified MC5b-9 solubilized from membranes of antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes treated with NHS but not with intermediate complement complexes. Poly C9-MA also reacted in a dose-dependent manner on ELISA and in a radioimmunoassay with polymerized C9 (37°C, 64 h) (poly C9) but not with monomeric C9. Increasing amounts of either unlabeled poly C9 or purified MC5b-9 inhibited the 125I-poly C9 RIA in an identical manner. These studies demonstrate that Poly C9-MA recognizes a neoantigen of C9 common to both the MAC and to poly C9. By immunofluorescence. Poly C9-MA reacted minimally with normal kidney tissue in juxtaglomerular loci, the mesangial stalk, and vessel walls. Poly C9-MA stained kidney tissue from patients with glomerulonephritis in a pattern similar to that seen with polyclonal anti-human C3. In tissue from patients with nonnephritic renal disease-diabetes, hypertension, and obstructive uropathy-Poly C9-MA was strongly reactive in the mesangial stalk and juxtaglomerular regions, tubular basement membranes, and vascular walls. Poly C9-MA binding was especially prominent in areas of advanced tissue injury. Poly C9-MA frequently stained loci where C3 was either minimally present or absent. These studies provide strong evidence for complement activation not only in nephritic but also in nonnephritic renal diseases.},

We hypothesized that the most frequent TCR clonotypes infiltrating the tumor were reactive against tumor antigens. To test this hypothesis, we developed a multistep strategy that involved TCRB deep sequencing of the CD8PD-1 T-cell subset, matching of TCRA-TCRB pairs by pairSEQ and single-cell RT-PCR, followed by testing of the TCRs for tumor-antigen specificity. Analysis of 12 fresh metastatic melanomas revealed that in 11 samples, up to 5 tumor-reactive TCRs were present in the 5 most frequently occurring clonotypes, which included reactivity against neoantigens.

MonAb E5D2 recognizes the antigenic determinant (epitope) buried in intact IgGl and expressed upon mild reduction of interchain S-S bridges. Neither H nor L chains alone maintain epitope E5D2. Reassociation of gamma 1 chains (H chains of IgGl) with L chains results in complete restoration of this antigenic determinant. The data strongly suggest that epitope E5D2 depends on the quaternary structure of IgG 1. The epitope is also expressed by reduced F(ab)2 fragment of IgGl but is not connected with its antigen binding site. The likely localization of the epitope E5D2 is the interface between CH and CL domains. The second produced monAb F6C2 reacts with CH1-CL region of reduced mouse IgG2. Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments have demonstrated pronounced decrease of the radius of gyration of reduced IgG 1 as compared tothe intact one. This indicates general conformational changes of IgGl molecule following mild reduction of Fab region S-S groups. Epitope E5D2 is the first quaternary antigenic subclass specific determinant described for C the region of mouse IgG. Thus, serologic expression of epitope E5D2 reveals precise conformational perturbations of small area near reduced S-S bridges while small-angle scattering demonstrates accompanying general transformation of IgG structure. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Tumor-specific mutations can result in immunogenic neoantigens, both of which have been correlated with responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors in highly mutagenic cancers. However, early results of single-agent checkpoint inhibitors in multiple myeloma (MM) have been underwhelming. Therefore, we sought to understand the relationship between mutation and neoantigen landscape of MM patients and responsiveness to therapies. Somatic mutation burden, neoantigen load, and response to therapy were determined using interim data from the MMRF CoMMpass study (NCT01454297) on 664 MM patients. In this population, the mean somatic and missense mutation loads were 405.84(s = 608.55) and 63.90(s = 95.88) mutations per patient, respectively. There was a positive linear relationship between mutation and neoantigen burdens (R2 = 0.862). The average predicted neoantigen load was 23.52 (s = 52.14) neoantigens with an average of 9.40(s = 26.97) expressed neoantigens. Survival analysis revealed significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with greater than average somatic missense mutation load (N = 163, 0.493 vs 0.726 2-year PFS, P = 0.0023) and predicted expressed neoantigen load (N = 214, 0.555 vs 0.729 2-year PFS, P = 0.0028). This pattern is maintained when stratified by disease stage and cytogenetic abnormalities. Therefore, high mutation and neoantigen load are clinically relevant risk factors that negatively impact survival of MM patients under current standards of care. © The Author(s) 2017.},

	abstract = {T cell immunity directed against tumor-encoded amino acid substitutions occurs in some melanoma patients. This implicates missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. However, a systematic evaluation of these putative neoantigens as targets of antitumor immunity is lacking. Moreover, it remains unknown whether vaccination can augment such responses.We found that a dendritic cell vaccine led to an increase in naturally occurring neoantigen-specific immunity and revealed previously undetected human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-restricted neoantigens in patients with advanced melanoma. The presentation of neoantigens by HLA-A∗02:01 in human melanoma was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Vaccination promoted a diverse neoantigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in terms of both TCR-b usage and clonal composition. Our results demonstrate that vaccination directed at tumor-encoded amino acid substitutions broadens the antigenic breadth and clonal diversity of antitumor immunity.},

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy against hypermutated cancers such as melanomas and lung carcinomas. One explanation for this effect is that hypermutated lesions harbor more tumor-specific neoantigens that stimulate recruitment of an increased number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which is counterbalanced by overexpression of immune checkpoints such as PD-1 or PD-L1. Given that BRCA1/2-mutated high grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs) exhibit a higher mutational load and a unique mutational signature with an elevated number of larger indels up to 50 bp, we hypothesized that they may also harbor more tumor-specific neoantigens, and, therefore, exhibit increased TILs and PD-1/PD-L1 expression. Here, we report significantly higher predicted neoantigens in BRCA1/2-mutated tumors compared to tumors without alterations in homologous recombination (HR) genes (HR-proficient tumors). Tumors with higher neoantigen load were associated with improved overall survival and higher expression of immune genes associated with tumor cytotoxicity such as genes of the TCR, the IFN-gamma and the TNFR pathways. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry studies demonstrated that BRCA1/2-mutated tumors exhibited significantly increased CD3+ and CD8+ TILs, as well as elevated expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in tumor-associated immune cells compared to HR-proficient tumors. Survival analysis showed that both BRCA1/2-mutation status and number of TILs were independently associated with outcome. Of note, two distinct groups of HGSOCs, one with very poor prognosis (HR proficient with low number of TILs) and one with very good prognosis (BRCA1/2-mutated tumors with high number of TILs) were defined. These findings support a link between BRCA1/2-mutation status, immunogenicity and survival, and suggesting that BRCA1/2-mutated HGSOCs may be more sensitive to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors compared to HR-proficient HGSOCs.},

	abstract = {Chronic beryllium (Be) disease is a granulomatous lung disorder that results from Be exposure in a genetically susceptible host. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of Be-responsive CD4+ T cells in the lung, and genetic susceptibility is primarily linked to HLA-DPB1 alleles possessing a glutamic acid at position 69 of the β-chain. Recent structural analysis of a Be-specific TCR interacting with a Be-loaded HLADP2- peptide complex revealed that Be is coordinated by amino acid residues derived from the HLA-DP2 β-chain and peptide and showed that the TCR does not directly interact with the Be2+ cation. Rather, the TCR recognizes a modified HLA-DP2-peptide complex with charge and conformational changes. Collectively, these findings provide a structural basis for the development of this occupational lung disease through the ability of Be to induce posttranslational modifications in preexisting HLA-DP2-peptide complexes, resulting in the creation of neoantigens. © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.

	abstract = {A key to improving cancer immunotherapy will be the identification of tumor-specific “neoantigens” that arise from mutations and augment the resultant host immune response. In this study we identified single nucleotide variants (SNVs) by RNA sequencing of asbestos-induced murine mesothelioma cell lines AB1 and AB1-HA. Using the NetMHCpan 2.8 algorithm, the theoretical binding affinity of predicted peptides arising from high-confidence, exonic, non-synonymous SNVs was determined for the BALB/c strain. The immunoreactivity to 20 candidate mutation-carrying peptides of increased affinity and the corresponding wild-type peptides was determined using interferon-γ ELISPOT assays and lymphoid organs of non-manipulated tumor-bearing mice. A strong endogenous immune response was demonstrated to one of the candidate neoantigens, Uqcrc2; this response was detected in the draining lymph node and spleen. Antigen reactive cells were not detected in non-tumor bearing mice. The magnitude of the response to the Uqcrc2 neoantigen was similar to that of the strong influenza hemagglutinin antigen, a model tumor neoantigen. This work confirms that the approach of RNAseq plus peptide prediction and ELISPOT testing is sufficient to identify natural tumor neoantigens. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {It has previously been reported that human C-reactive protein (CRP) can exist in at least two molecular conformations distinguished by antigenic, electrophoretic and ligand-binding reactivities. In the present study we describe the formation, detection and distinctiveness of a conformation expressing a CRP neoantigen (neo-CRP), and report that this form is characteristic in vitro of a free CRP subunit. Soluble native-CRP was found to express neo-CRP antigenicity upon treatment with acid; upon urea-chelation or heating in the absence of calcium; and upon adsorption onto uncoated polystyrene plates. Native-CRP bound by capture ELISA to phosphorylcholine-containing ligand or anti-native-CRP did not express neo-CRP antigenicity, suggesting that PC ligand- or antibody binding is not sufficient to induce expression of the neoantigen. Human CRP which expressed neo-CRP antigenicity had limited solubility and tended to aggregate in buffers of ionic strength 0.15, but remained soluble when the ionic strength was reduced to 0.015. Soluble urea-chelated or acid-treated CRP molecules expressing neo-CRP antigenicity chromatographed and electrophoresed as a single protein with a Mr of approx. 22,000, indicating that the CRP neoantigen can be expressed on free CRP subunits and this expression need not require proteolysis. Further, molecules expressing neo-CRP antigenicity were detected in the plasma of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The identification and characterization of this CRP neoantigen should serve as a useful marker in studies of CRP subunits and biologically relevant forms of CRP, and should contribute to the elucidation of the role of CRP in the acute inflammatory response. © 1987.},

	abstract = {The "cancer immunogenomics" paradigm has facilitated the search for tumor-specific antigens over the last 4 years by applying comprehensive cancer genomics to tumor antigen discovery. We applied this methodology to identify tumor-specific "neoantigens" in the C57BL/6-derived GL261 and VM/Dk-derived SMA- 560 tumor models. Following DNA whole-exome and RNA sequencing, high-affinity candidate neoepitopes were predicted and screened for immunogenicity by ELISPOT and tetramer analyses. GL261 and SMA-560 harbored 4,932 and 2,171 nonsynonymous exome mutations, respectively, of which less than half were expressed. To establish the immunogenicities of H-2Kb and H-2Db candidate neoantigens, we assessed the ability of the epitopes predicted in silico to be the highest affinity binders to activate tumor-infiltrating T cells harvested from GL261 and SMA-560 tumors. Using IFNγg ELISPOT, we confirmed H-2Db- restricted Imp3D81N (GL261) and Odc1Q129L (SMA-560) along with H-2Kb-restricted E2f8K272R (SMA-560) as endogenous tumor-specific neoantigens that are functionally immunogenic. Furthermore, neoantigen-specific T cells to Imp3D81N and Odc1Q129L were detected within intracranial tumors as well as cervical draining lymph nodes by tetramer analysis. By establishing the immunogenicities of predicted high-affinity neoepitopes in these models, we extend the immunogenomics-based neoantigen discovery pipeline to glioblastoma models and provide a tractable system to further study the mechanism of action of T cell-activating immunotherapeutic approaches in preclinical models of glioblastoma. © 2016 AACR.},

Mouse LTK - cells were cotransformed with recombinant plasmids containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene and either EcoRI fragment B or BamHI fragment K of EBV DNA. The TK + cells surviving in selective medium were cloned. About 50% of the clones expressed the neoantigen in every nucleus. These mouse cells were used as antigens in immunofluoresence tests. Antibody to the nuclear antigen was found in 30 human sera known to contain antibody to EBNA; it was not detected in 18 sera that did not have antibody to EBNA. Mouse cells expressing EBNA as the result of acquisition of cloned EBV DNA fragments should prove useful in the characterization of the structure of this antigen and as reagents for the diagnosis of EBV infections.},

We present data that baboons transplanted with highly purified allogeneic CD34+ marrow cells devoid of detectable mature and immature T and B lymphocytes and myeloid cells, isolated from sex-mismatched mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) nonreactive siblings, have maintained stable lymphohematopoietic engraftment with donor cells for greater then 4.9, greater than 6.0, and 5.0 years. Cytogenetic analysis of unfractionated marrow and peripheral blood cells at multiple time points after transplantation show virtually all donor cells in two animals and stable mixed chimerism in the third. We used polymerase chain reaction to show that colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage, burst-forming unit- erythroid, and high proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFC) were virtually all of donor origin in two animals and present at lower levels in the stable mixed chimera. CD20+ B-lymphoblastoid cell lines derived by Herpesvirus Papio transformation of peripheral blood cells were virtually all donor in two animals and 50% donor in the mixed chi-mera. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and neutrophils purified from the peripheral blood of the two female animals also were all donor-derived. To assess immunologic function after transplantation, we immunized the three long-term chimeric animals and two normal control animals with bacteriophage ΦX-174, a neoantigen that requires the interaction of antigen-presenting cells, T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes to mount a normal antibody response. Experimental and control animals, when immunized with bacteriophage, had similar serum Ig levels. The experimental and control animals generated similar liters of antibacteriophage antibodies after primary and secondary immunizations with evidence of amplification and class switching. These findings further support the hypothesis that the CD34+ antigen is expressed on hematopoietic stem cells that can mediate stable long-term lymphohematopoiesis in vivo and, importantly, that normal immunologic function can be reconstituted in vivo after transplantation of the highly purified CD34+ Lin- cells alone.},

After transduction, the E1-deleted vector was rapidly eliminated, but the modified vector persisted for at least 2 months (experiment duration). Modified vector persistence was also accompanied by prolonged transgene expression and decreased hepatotoxicity profiles. This result was in contrast to several reports suggesting that the transgene expressed by an Ad vector is the primary determinant of Ad vector elimination in vivo. Our results implied that the rapid immune clearance of Ad-transduced cells in vivo is codependent on the presence of two stimuli, or 'hits.' Hit 1 is due to Ad vector-derived gene expression while hit 2 is due to transgene immunogenicity. Attenuation of the first hit by the use of a significantly modified vector (such as the [E1-, polymerase-] Ad vector) allowed for extended persistence, despite the continued presence of the transgene-derived stimulus (hit 2). We discuss how the two hit hypothesis is in fact congruent with a number of other reports that have analyzed Ad vector persistence in immune-competent animals. On the basis of our results, [E1-, polymerase-] Ad vectors should have broad benefits for use in human gene therapy situations in which the encoded transgene may be perceived as a neoantigen by the intact human immune system.},

Although correlation coefficients between each pair were statistically significant, several samples showed discrepancies among the three FDP parameters. In order to test the possibility that these discrepancies might be caused by the difference in the affinity of the three antibodies to each FDP fragment, we analyzed the profiles of FDP fragments by Western blotting. Consequently, we found abundant high-molecular-weight (HMW) and/or D fragments in some samples which showed low FDP-DD and FDP-E values relative to FDP-T values. Generally, FDP-DD is considered to be the most reliable parameter for monitoring fibrinolysis. However, our study indicated that FDP-T is remarkably useful whenever FDP-DD values are lower than expected from the clinical parameters and/or other laboratory test data used for diagnosis of DIC. © 1995, Japan Society of Clinical Chemistry.

	abstract = {We investigated the humoral (antigen-specific immunoglobulin isotypes, IgG subclasses, and avidity maturation) and cellular (antigen-specific in vitro proliferation) immune response in 18 healthy adult volunteers, following a primary and a single booster vaccination with the T-cell dependent neoantigen rabies administered at a 3-months interval. The IgG antibody titer showed a mean 31-fold increase (range 3-154) 4 weeks after the first vaccination and a memory response was observed after booster vaccination, i.e. high IgG titers, switch from IgM to IgG and IgA and increased antibody avidity. All healthy adults showed a rabies-induced proliferative response with a mean stimulation index of 45 (range 3.5-200) after in vitro stimulation of PBMC obtained at 4 weeks after booster vaccination. The results obtained in this study provide a frame of reference for the interpretation of specific immune responses to the T-cell dependent neoantigen rabies in patients suspected of a primary or secondary immunodeficiency. Humoral and cellular immune responses to the rabies neoantigen provide complementary information on the condition of the immune system of an individual. Five patients diagnosed with a combined immunodeficiency were vaccinated using the same protocol and showed a number of abnormalities, either in the humoral or the cellular immune response to the rabies neoantigen.},

The activity in normal human EDTA plasma was found to be 3% of that in a zymosan-activated serum pool. Fractionation experiments revealed that most of the activity in normal plasma, in vivo activated plasma and in vitro activated serum eluted in one peak with a molecular weight corresponding to iC3b. A positive correlation (P<0.01) was found between the present assay anda previously established two-step C3d ELISA both with respect to normal plasma, individual patient samples and consecutively drawn samples following artificial in vivo activation.

	abstract = {The application of modern high-throughput genomics to the study of cancer genomes has exploded in the past few years, yielding unanticipated insights into the myriad and complex combinations of genomic alterations that lead to the development of cancers. Coincident with these genomic approaches have been computational analyses that are capable of multiplex evaluations of genomic data toward specific therapeutic end points. One such approach is called "immunogenomics" and is now being developed to interpret protein-altering changes in cancer cells in the context of predicted preferential binding of these altered peptides by the patient's immune molecules, specifically human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II proteins. One goal of immunogenomics is to identify those cancer-specific alterations that are likely to elicit an immune response that is highly specific to the patient's cancer cells following stimulation by a personalized vaccine. The elements of such an approach are outlined herein and constitute an emerging therapeutic option for cancer patients. © 2016 Hundal et al.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy has shown benefit in various cancers, but their potential in endometrial cancer (EC) is unknown. OBSERVATIONS: Prediction of neoantigen load was performed using sequencing data from the Cancer Genome Atlas data set. Evaluation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and PD-1 and PD-L1 expression was performed in 63 patients with EC referred to our institution. The predicted median (range) neoantigen load (predicted neoepitopes per sample) was proportional to the mutational load: highest in ultramutated polymerase e (POLE) tumors (8342 [628-20 440]), less in hypermutated MSI (541 [146-8063]; P < .001), and lowest in microsatellite-stable tumors (70.5 [7-1877]; P < .001). The POLE and MSI ECs exhibited higher numbers of CD3+ (44.5 vs 21.8; P = .001) and CD8+ (32.8 vs 13.5; P < .001) TILs compared with microsatellite-stable tumors. PD-1 was overexpressed in TILs (81% vs 28%; P < .001) and peritumoral lymphocytes (90% vs 28%; P < .001) of POLE and MSI tumors. PD-L1 expression was infrequently noted in tumor cells but was common in intraepithelial immune cells and more frequent in POLE and MSI tumors (39% vs 13%; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Polymerase e-mutated and MSI ECs are associated with high neoantigen loads and number of TILs, which is counterbalanced by overexpression of PD-1 and PD-L1. Polymerase e-mutated and MSI EC tumors may be excellent candidates for PD-1-targeted immunotherapies. Copyright 2015 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

In a previous series of experiments a unique TCR Vβ16+ T cell was shown to be highly expanded at the tumor site. The corresponding clone was isolated in vitro and found to be a CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte with a strong and selective cytolytic activity against the autologous tumor cell line. Here, we demonstrate that this predominant Vβ16+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte recognizes a peptide encoded by a novel unconventional myosin class I gene. This peptide includes a mutation due to a single nucleotide substitution. The resulting Glu→Lys replacement at position 911 of the coding sequence is critical to generate the recognized T cell epitope. These experiments demonstrate the existence of a natural tumor-specific cytolytic T cell response in a primary regressing human melanoma lesion.},

In the four rheumatoid arthritis patients there was extensive deposition of C3 activation products and C5b-9 complexes onto the synovial membrane and the pattern of deposition of both neoantigens in serial tissue sections was very similar. There was less extensive staining for C3 and, particularly, C9 neoepitopes on the apical surface of vessel endothelia. In two of four osteoarthritic patients a similar pattern of C3 and C9 neoepitope deposition was found; in the remaining patients no C5b-9 could be located. Synovial vessel walls, but not synovial cells, from both groups of patients stained extensively for the complement regulatory protein CD59. In synovial membranes from patients with osteoarthritis, C9 appeared to be present predominantly in SCSb-9 complexes whereas in rheumatoid arthritis patients no evidence of S-protein incorporation into membrane attack complexes could be demonstrated, suggesting that in rheumatoid arthritis there is damage to the synovial membrane as a result of complement activation and C5b-9 deposition.},

	abstract = {These studies were performed to investigate the cause(s) of the cathodal shift of mobility seen in crossed immunoelectrophoresis of antithrombin antigen in plasma of hemophilic patients after factor IX concentrate therapy. These plasmas were shown to contain antithrombin neoantigen with apparent identity to the neoantigen present in normal serum but not present in normal plasma. Sephacryl S-200 gel chromatography of serum demonstrated that the neoantigen eluted with the first two, early eluting protein peaks; thus the neoantigen had a higher molecular weight than native antithrombin. When the chromatographic fractions containing the neoantigen were studied by crossed immunoelectrophoresis, they were found to contain antithrombin antigen of more cathodal mobility than normal. Sephacryl S-200 chromatography of factor IX concentrate-treated hemophilic plasma also showed an early eluting peak of antithrombin antigen of more cathodal mobility than normal in crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The mobility of this peak was identical to the cathodal peak found in normal serum and in early eluting fractions from chromatography of normal serum.

	abstract = {Due to advances in sequencing technology, somatically mutated cancer antigens, or neoantigens, are now readily identifiable and have become compelling targets for immunotherapy. In particular, neoantigen-targeted vaccines have shown promise in several preclinical and clinical studies. However, to date, neoantigen-targeted vaccine studies have involved tumors with exceptionally high mutation burdens. It remains unclear whether neoantigen-targeted vaccines will be broadly applicable to cancers with intermediate to low mutation burdens, such as ovarian cancer. To address this, we assessed whether a derivative of the murine ovarian tumor model ID8 could be targeted with neoantigen vaccines. We performed whole exome and transcriptome sequencing on ID8-G7 cells. We identified 92 somatic mutations, 39 of which were transcribed, missense mutations. For the 17 top predicted MHC class I binding mutations, we immunized mice subcutaneously with synthetic long peptide vaccines encoding the relevant mutation. Seven of 17 vaccines induced robust mutation-specific CD4 and/or CD8 T cell responses. However, none of the vaccines prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice in either the prophylactic or therapeutic setting. Moreover, none of the neoantigen-specific T cell lines recognized ID8-G7 tumor cells in vitro, indicating that the corresponding mutations did not give rise to bonafide MHC-presented epitopes. Additionally, bioinformatic analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data revealed that only 12% (26/220) of HGSC cases had a ≥90% likelihood of harboring at least one authentic, naturally processed and presented neoantigen versus 51% (80/158) of lung cancers. Our findings highlight the limitations of applying neoantigen-targeted vaccines to tumor types with intermediate/low mutation burdens. © 2016 Martin et al.

	abstract = {Tumors commonly harbor multiple genetic alterations, some of which initiate tumorigenesis. Among these, some tumorspecific somatic mutations resulting in mutated protein have the potential to induce antitumor immune responses. To examine the relevance of the latter to immune responses in the tumor and to patient outcomes, we used datasets of wholeexome and RNA sequencing from 97 clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients to identify neoepitopes predicted to be presented by each patient's autologous HLA molecules. We found that the number of nonsilent or missense mutations did not correlate with patient prognosis. However, combining the number of HLA-restricted neoepitopes with the cell surface expression of HLA or β2 -microglobulin (β2 M) revealed that an A-neohi /HLA-Ahi or ABC-neohi /β2 Mhi phenotype correlated with better clinical outcomes. Higher expression of immunerelated genes from CD8 T cells and their effector molecules [CD8A, perforin (PRF1) and granzyme A (GZMA)], however, did not correlate with prognosis. This may have been due to the observed correlation of these genes with the expression of other genes that were associated with immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (CTLA-4, PD-1, LAG-3, PD-L1, PD-L2, IDO1, and IL10). This suggested that abundant neoepitopes associated with greater antitumor effector immune responses were counterbalanced by a strongly immunosuppressive microenvironment. Therefore, immunosuppressive molecules should be considered high-priority targets for modulating immune responses in patients with ccRCC. Blockade of these molecular pathways could be combined with immunotherapies targeting neoantigens to achieve synergistic antitumor activity. © 2016 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Neoantigens unique to each patient's tumor can be recognized by autologous T cells through their T-cell receptor (TCR) but the low frequency and/or terminal differentiation of mutation-specific T cells in tumors can limit their utility as adoptive T-cell therapies. Transfer of TCR genes into younger T cells from peripheral blood with a high proliferative potential could obviate this problem. We generated a rapid, cost-effective strategy to genetically engineer cancer patient T cells with TCRs using the clinical Sleeping Beauty transposon/transposase system. Patient-specific TCRs reactive against HLA-A∗0201-restriced neoantigens AHNAK S2580F or ERBB2 H473Y or the HLA-DQB∗0601-restricted neoantigen ERBB2IP E805G were assembled with murine constant chains and cloned into Sleeping Beauty transposons. Patient peripheral blood lymphocytes were coelectroporated with SB11 transposase and Sleeping Beauty transposon, and transposed T cells were enriched by sorting on murine TCRβ (mTCRβ) expression. Rapid expansion of mTCRβ + T cells with irradiated allogeneic peripheral blood lymphocytes feeders, OKT3, interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-15, and IL-21 resulted in a preponderance of effector (CD27 - CD45RA -) and less-differentiated (CD27 + CD45RA +) T cells. Transposed T cells specifically mounted a polyfunctional response against cognate mutated neoantigens and tumor cell lines. Thus, Sleeping Beauty transposition of mutation-specific TCRs can facilitate the use of personalized T-cell therapy targeting unique neoantigens.},

	abstract = {The antitumor activity of CD4+ T cells is increasingly acknowledged in both humans and mice. The involved mechanisms have been mostly studied using transplanted tumor mouse systems. In these models, many tumor cells die at the time of implantation leading to the release of Ag in an inflammatory context contrasting with the slow and nondestructive growth of early-stage human tumors. In this study, we show that the presentation of a MHC class II-restricted model Ag (male, DBY) released by dying tumor cells may last more than 4 wk. The duration of Ag presentation varies according to the way the cells are killed before implantation. To avoid this artifactual early priming of the host precluding the study of the interactions between the immune system and tumors at the steady state, we generated a cell line expressing the DBY Ag in an inducible manner. Ag expression can be efficiently induced in vivo several days after tumor implantation. We show that the Ag reaches the lymph node and activates naive CD4+ T cells to proliferate and recirculate. We did not observe de novo induction of tumor-specific regulatory T cells. However, we observed Th1/Th17 effector cells in the tumor draining lymph node and tumors. Thus, when a neoantigen appears in established tumors, the immune system is not ignorant and naive CD4+ T cells are not tolerized. This opens up the possibility of therapeutic vaccines improving the immune response toward tumor-specific neoantigens. Copyright © 2015 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.},

The plasma iC3b‐NEO level in 40 untreated patients with active SLE was significantly higher than that in 36 normal subjects (mean ± SD 31.5 ± 13.9 μg/ml versus 12.3 ± 3.3 μg/ml; P < 0.001). The plasma iC3b‐NEO level was highly correlated with clinical disease activity (τ = 0.62, P < 0.0001), and it was the parameter most closely correlated with renal histologic activity in lupus nephritis (τ = 0.52, P < 0.0001). Also, patients with diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis had the highest levels of plasma iC3b‐NEO among all World Health Organization classes of lupus nephritis (P < 0.01). We conclude that the plasma iC3b‐NEO level is strongly associated with clinical disease activity and renal histologic activity in patients with SLE, and that plasma iC3b‐NEO may be a sensitive and useful measure of complement activation in SLE.

	abstract = {An aging antigen, senescent cell antigen, resides on the 911 amino acid membrane protein band 3. It marks cells for removal by initiating specific IgG autoantibody binding. Band 3 is a ubiquitous membrane transport protein found in the plasma membrane of diverse cell types and tissues, and in nuclear, mitochondrial and Golgi membranes. Band 3 in tissues such as brain performs the same functions as it does in red cells. Senescent cell antigen is generated on brain membranes. Oxidation is a mechanism for generating senescent cell antigen. Neither cross-linking nor hemoglobin appear to play a role in generating senescent cell antigen. Although storage is the only in vitro model that mimics cellular aging in situ, we have discovered three alterations/mutations of band 3 that permit insight into aging in situ. One mutation with an addition to band 3 has normal or decelerated red cell aging. In contrast, another band 3 alteration with a suspected deletion or substitution that renders band 3 more susceptible to proteolysis, shows accelerated aging. The third alteration which is also more susceptible to proteolysis is associated with neurologic defects. Peptide technology was used to map the aging antigenic sites and anion transport sites on band 3 using a competitive inhibition assay and immunoblotting with IgG directed against the aging antigen on old cells. Results indicate that: a) aging antigenic sites reside on human band 3 residues 538-554, and 812-830; b) a putative ankyrin binding region peptide is not involved in senescent cell antigen activity and c) carbohydrate moieties are not required for the antigenicity or recognition of senescent cell antigen since synthetic peptides alone abolish binding of senescent cell IgG to erythrocytes. Peptide residues 588-594 (a 7 amino acid peptide), 822-839 and 869-883 were the most active inhibitors of anion transport (P < or = 0.001 compared to control without peptide). Localization of the active antigenic and transport sites on band 3 molecule facilitates the definition of molecular changes occurring during aging that initiate molecular as well as cellular degeneration. The role of senescent cell antigen and band 3 in brain aging and Alzheimer's disease is discussed.},

	abstract = {Immune reconstitution after HAART is incomplete, but no widely accepted method to quantify subclinical immune deficiency is available. We immunized 9 HIV-negative subjects and 29 HIV-infected patients with CD4 ≥ 450 cells/μL and undetectable HIV RNA levels with 2 doses of diphtheria/tetanus toxoid (TT) and KLH, a presumed neoantigen. We quantified the response by lymphoproliferative assay, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), and antibody titers up to 59. days after enrollment. We assessed T cell proliferative capacity using anti-Vβ3 and anti-Vβ5 antibody stimulation, which we herein show induced predominant proliferation of naïve T cells. Subjects with detectable responses to KLH tended to exhibit greater proliferative responses to anti-Vβ3/Vβ5 stimulation; no such pattern was seen with response to TT. Several measures of in vitro T cell proliferative capacity correlated significantly with DTH and antibody responses to KLH, but not with TT responses; this association was independent of naïve T cell numbers. Our results indicate that naïve T cell proliferation predicts response to neo-, but not recall antigens, and suggest that it may be a meaningful reflection of in vivo immune competence in HIV-infected persons. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Using urea-solubilized human fibrin monomer as an immunogen, we raised in mice a battery of monoclonal antibodies that reacted with the immunogen but not with ureatreated or native fibrinogen. Although they all failed to react with acid-solubili/ed fibrin monomer (acid-FM) alone, an antibody designated as IF-43 was found to recognize acidFM, which was bound with fibrinogen or its derivatives to form a 1:2 complex of soluble fibrin. The epitope for this antibody, thus, appears to be exposed most probably by conformation changes induced in the acid-FM molecule upon formation of the complex. Since IF-43 was able to recognize fibrin-derived plasmic fragment E treated with urea but the thrombin- and urea-treated amino-terminal disulfide knot of fibrinogen, the presence of the Aa (52-78) residue segment seems to be prerequisite for the epitope expression. The antibody was found to react with soluble fibrin monomer spiked to normal plasma dose-dependently up to 200ng/mL. By an aggregation assay using latex beads coated with IF-43, we found that concentrations of soluble fibrin monomer in plasma derived from patients with thrombotic diseases were mostly elevated, but not necessarily correlated with those of the D-dimer, reflecting other aspects of the diseases. Furthermore, the soluble fibrin monomer in plasma derived from patients with thrombotic diseases was found to be depleted solely of the A peptides, but not the B peptides, based on its subunit polypeptide compositions lacking the b-chain on immunoblotting. © Pearson Professional Ltd 1996.},

	abstract = {Recognition of neoantigens that are formed as a consequence of DNA damage is likely to form a major driving force behind the clinical activity of cancer immunotherapies such as T-cell checkpoint blockade and adoptive T-cell therapy. Therefore, strategies to selectively enhance T-cell reactivity against genetically defined neoantigens are currently under development. In mouse models, T-cell pressure can sculpt the antigenicity of tumours, resulting in the emergence of tumours that lack defined mutant antigens. However, whether the T-cell-recognized neoantigen repertoire in human cancers is constant over time is unclear. Here we analyse the stability of neoantigen-specific T-cell responses and the antigens they recognize in two patients with stage IV melanoma treated by adoptive T-cell transfer. The T-cell-recognized neoantigens can be selectively lost from the tumour cell population, either by overall reduced expression of the genes or loss of the mutant alleles. Notably, loss of expression of T-cell-recognized neoantigens was accompanied by development of neoantigen-specific T-cell reactivity in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. These data demonstrate the dynamic interactions between cancer cells and T cells, which suggest that T cells mediate neoantigen immunoediting, and indicate that the therapeutic induction of broad neoantigen-specific T-cell responses should be used to avoid tumour resistance. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

	abstract = {Human cancers express organ-specific neoantigens (OSNs) that elicit immune responses in the tumor host. Leukocyte adherence inhibition, an in vitro assay that detects the antitumor immunity, was used to monitor the purification of the OSN from serum-free spent medium of tissue-cultured colon cancer cell lines (HCT-15 and SW-620). A monoclonal antibody (anti-p40) directed to a cross-reactive framework determinant of Mr40,000 (p40) cell surface polypeptide, which was a principal component of the enriched isolate with OSN activity, was used to monitor the purification of p40 by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. About 50 liters of spent medium were generated from 20 m2 of cells, collected, concentrated, and then separated by anion exchange, molecular-sieve, and blue-Sepharose affinity chromatography. OSN and p40 activity coisolated. p40 was then purified by monoclonal antibody anti-p40 affinity chromatography. The affinity-purified fraction was enriched for both p40 and leukocyte adherence inhibition activity that was specific for leukocytes from colon cancer patients in blind leukocyte adherence inhibition assays. When affinity-purified p40 from colon and lung cancers was tested blind in a criss-cross fashion with leukocytes from colon and lung cancer patients, the positive responses were to the appropriate p40. The homologous colon cancer p40 molecule showed size and considerable charge microheterogeneity (pI 6.3 to 7.6). Affinity-purified p40 and OSN coisolated on hydrophobic interaction and hydroxylapatite high-pressure liquid chromatography. Note that not all colon cancer OSN activity was bound by the anti-p40 affinity column. However, unbound OSN activity also eluted from hydrophobic interaction high-pressure liquid chromatography at the same time as affinity-purified p40, and residual p40 activity was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. The results indicate that a p40 glycoprotein from the cell membrane of colon cancer cells coisolates with fractions having OSN activity. Impurities do not seem to account for the OSN activity. The OSN epitope on the Mr40,000 molecule is recognized by leukocytes from colon cancer patients and is distinct from the cross-reactive framework determinant recognized by mouse monoclonal antibody anti-p40. © 1986, American Association for Cancer Research.

	abstract = {In a model of transplantation rejection, we tested whether a graft manipulated to secrete an immunomodulator could protect itself from immune destruction, thus waiving the need for administration of exogenous immunosuppressants to the recipient. An insulinoma cell line, NIT, having the nonobese diabetic (NOD) genotype but also expressing the SV40 large T antigen, was transfected with CTLA4Ig in an attempt to block the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway between antigen-presenting cells and T lymphocytes near the site of the graft. The SV40 T antigen is potent at inducing graft rejection. NIT.CTLA4Ig and control transfectants were transplanted subcutaneously into young NOD mice to determine whether CTLA4Ig secretion would abet the survival of the insulinoma graft. CTLA4Ig protein was secreted abundantly in vitro (3-5 μg/ml) and this phenotype was maintained in vivo. Tumor growth was monitored visibly, by palpation, by measuring blood glucose levels, and by death of the host from hypoglycemia caused by unregulated insulin production of the growing insulinoma. Cell growth was similar for NIT.CTLA4Ig and control transfectants in immunodeficient mice (nude, irradiated, or SCID mice), indicating that there was no intrinsic growth advantage of the NIT.CTLA4Ig cells. In immunocompetent NOD mice, however, the survival/growth of the NIT.CTLA4Ig graft was significantly better than that of the controls. Histopathology was consistent with this finding. Donor- specific second-set grafts were acutely rejected, indicating that tolerance was not induced. CTLs were generated even when the graft secreted CTLA4Ig; there was no clear difference in in vitro immune responses generated by NIT.CTLA4Ig and control cells. We conclude that blockade of the B7 costimulation pathway by graft manipulation can contribute to transplantation success.},

	abstract = {In many clinical cases, uveitis develops secondary to an infection. This could result from peripheral activation followed by ocular penetration and reactivation of T cells specific for microbial Ags expressed in the retina. To gain insights into the pathophysiology of uveitis, we developed a new mouse model based on stable retinal expression of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) neoantigen by adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer. One month thereafter, we adoptively transferred HA-specific T cells, which were activated in vitro or in vivo. Intraocular inflammation was clinically and histologically observed in all animals within 15 days. The ocular infiltrate was composed mostly of macrophages and HA-specific T cells with a proinflammatory cytokine profile. Depletion of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells exacerbated the disease, whereas HA-specific CD4+CD25+ T cells given i.v. controlled the disease. This novel model should allow to better study the pathophysiology and therapeutic of uveitis. Copyright © 2006 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.},

Here we characterize the primary CD4 T-cell immune response to protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) In 5 metastatic melanoma patients undergoing a tumor peptide-based dendritic cell vaccination trial. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells displaying a semimature phenotype, as defined by surface markers, were loaded ex vivo with antigen and injected intranodally at weekly intervals for 4 weeks. All patients developed a strong and long-lasting delayed-type hypersensitivity reactivity to KLH, which correlated with the induction of KLH-dependent proliferation of CD4 T cells in vitro. Secondary in vitro stimulation with KLH showed significant increase in interferon-γ and interleukin-2 (IL-2) but not IL-4, IL-5, nor IL-10 secretion by bulk T cells. On the single-cell level, most TH1 cells among in vitro-generated KLH-specific T-cell lines confirmed the preferential induction of a KLH-specific type 1 T helper immune response. Furthermore, the induction of KLH-specific antibodies of the IgG2 sub-type may reflect the induction of a type 1 cytokine profile in vivo after vaccination. Our results indicate that intranodal vaccination with semimature DCs can prime strong, long-lasting CD4 T-cell responses with a TH1-type cytokine profile in cancer patients. © 2003 by The American Society of Hematology.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a primary brain tumor with a median survival of 14.6 months postdiagnosis. The infiltrative nature of GBM prevents complete resection and residual brain tumor cells give rise to recurrent GBM, a hallmark of this disease. Recurrent GBMs are known to harbor numerous mutations/gene rearrangements when compared to the primary tumor, which leads to the potential expression of novel proteins that could serve as tumor neoantigens. We have developed a combined immune-based gene therapeutic approach for GBM using adenoviral (Ads) mediated gene delivery of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1-thymidine kinase (TK) into the tumor mass to induce tumor cells' death combined with an adenovirus expressing fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) to recruit dendritic cells (DCs) into the tumor microenvironment. This leads to the induction of specific anti-brain tumor immunity and immunological memory. In a model of GBM recurrence, we demonstrate that Flt3L/TK mediated immunological memory is capable of recognizing brain tumor neoantigens absent from the original treated tumor. These data demonstrate that the Flt3L/TK gene therapeutic approach can induce systemic immunological memory capable of recognizing a brain tumor neoantigen in a model of recurrent GBM. © 2011 The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy.},

Neoantigens are present both in the membrane‐bound (MAC) and the fluid‐phase (SC5b‐9) complex. The present study describes production of monoclonal antibodies against neoantigens of both forms of the TCC. A convenient screening and detection system, based mainly on enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays, crossed immunoelectrophoresis with autoradiography, and affinity chromatography with subsequent sodium dodecyl sulphate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis including immunoblotting, is described in detail. Two monoclonal antibodies were specific for a neoantigen located in the poly(C9) moiety of the TCC. One of these antibodies, MCaE11, was used for immunohistochemical detection of MAC in tissue and for quantification of the fluid‐phase TCC in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid plasma.

Gene-specific PCR and immunohistochemical studies revealed ASTL messages and SAS1B protein in both endometrioid [74%] and malignant mixed Mullerian tumors (MMMT) [87%] of the uterus. A MMMT-derived cell line, SNU539, expressed cell surface SAS1B that, after binding polyclonal antibodies, internalized into EEA1/LAMP1-positive early and late endosomes. Treatment of SNU539 cells with anti-SAS1B polyclonal antibodies caused growth arrest in the presence of active complement. A saporin-immunotoxin directed to SAS1B induced growth arrest and cell death. The oocyte restricted expression pattern of SAS1B among adult organs, cell-surface accessibility, internalization into the endocytic pathway, and tumor cell growth arrest induced by antibody-toxin conjugates suggest therapeutic approaches that would selectively target tumors while limiting adverse drug effects in healthy cells. The SAS1B metalloproteinase is proposed as a prototype cancer-oocyte tumor surface neoantigen for development of targeted immunotherapeutics with limited on-target/off tumor effects predicted to be restricted to the population of growing oocytes.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of the T-cell immune response following primary antigenic challenge with a neoantigen is a critical aspect of assessment of the cellular immune response. While many antigens can be used to accurately assess in vitro T-cell proliferation to a recall antigen, only a few neoantigens have been tested for their capacities to measure T-cell responses in vitro to a primary immunization. Rabies vaccination is an excellent candidate for the testing of T-cell proliferation responses to a primary immunization because few individuals have been exposed to rabies virus antigens. In the present study 14 rabies vaccine-naïve, healthy adult volunteers were immunized against rabies virus, and T-cell proliferation and antibody responses were measured before and after vaccination. Optimal lymphocyte proliferation to soluble rabies virus antigen occurred after 8 days in culture. The average level of uptake of tritiated thymidine postimmunization was 29,620 ± 4,448 cpm, whereas preimmunization levels were 12,660 ± 3,448 cpm (P = 0.002). All individuals showed increases in rabies virus antibody titers from <0.05 to 5.59 ± 1.64 IU/ml. The degree of proliferation to tetanus toxoid as a recall antigen was similar to the response to rabies virus antigen among the cohort. Due to high levels of preimmunization proliferation, four subjects failed to demonstrate a twofold increase in response to rabies virus antigen. The high levels of T-cell responses may be due to a viral superantigen effect in some individuals. Rabies vaccination offers a safe and effective means for measurement of both T- and B-cell immune responses to a neoantigen in healthy and immune suppressed individuals.},

	abstract = {Emerging clinical evidence on the role of the antitumor activity of the immune system has generated great interest in immunotherapy in all cancer types. Recent clinical data clearly demonstrated that human tumor cells express antigenic peptides (epitopes) that can be recognized by autologous tumor-specific T cells and that enhancement of such immune reactivity can potentially lead to cancer control and cancer regression in patients with advanced disease. However, in most cases, it is unclear which tumor antigens (Ags) mediated cancer regression. Mounting evidence indicates that numerous endogenous mutated cancer proteins, a hallmark of tumor cells, can be processed into peptides and presented on the surface of tumor cells, leading to their immune recognition in vivo as "non-self" or foreign. Massively parallel sequencing has now overcome the challenge of rapidly identifying the comprehensive mutational spectrum of individual tumors (i.e., the "mutanome") and current technologies, as well as computational tools, have emerged that allow the identification of private epitopes derived from their mutanome and called neoantigens (neoAgs). On this basis, both CD4+ and CD8+ neoantigen-specific T cells have been identified in multiple human cancers and shown to be associated with a favorable clinical outcome. Notably, emerging data also indicate that neoantigen recognition represents a major factor in the activity of clinical immunotherapies. In the post-genome era, the mutanome holds promise as a long-awaited 'gold mine' for the discovery of unique cancer cell targets, which are exclusively tumor-specific and unlikely to drive immune tolerance, hence offering the chance for highly promising clinical programs of cancer immunotherapy. © Annals of Translational Medicine.},

	abstract = {Primary allergic sensitization-IgE formation after Ag exposure-is fundamental in the development of allergic respiratory disease. With the rising prevalence of asthma and allergic rhinitis, improved understanding of the determining factors for allergic sensitization is needed. Human epidemiologic studies suggest high-dose allergen exposure may paradoxically protect against sensitization. Prospective human studies of allergen dose effect on primary allergic sensitization are lacking. We prospectively examined the effect of respiratory Ag dose exposure on the rate of primary allergic sensitization to a neoantigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, using a unique model of human nasal allergic sensitization. Atopic human subjects were exposed to 0.1-, 10-, 1,000-, or 100,000-μg doses of intranasal keyhole limpet hemocyanin in conjunction with adjuvant intranasal diesel exhaust particles. Ag-specific IgE, IgG, and IgG4 were measured in nasal lavage samples at the conclusion of the sensitization protocol. Allergic sensitization rates for the 0.1-, 10-, 1,000-, and 100,000-μg dose groups were 0, 100, 57, and 11%, respectively. All subjects produced Ag-specific IgG with the highest levels observed in the high-dose group. These results provide direct evidence that primary allergic sensitization may be prevented by initial high levels of respiratory Ag exposure through induction of a modified, nonallergic immune response. This Ag dose effect was capable of overcoming the well-established allergic adjuvant effects of diesel exhaust particle exposure. Whether this immune response represents durable allergic tolerance is not yet known. Studies investigating the molecular mechanisms of this non-IgE response may be useful in developing therapy to prevent allergic sensitization.

All vaccines tested to date targeted tumor associated antigens (TAA) that are self-antigens and failed to show a clinical efficacy because of the immune self-tolerance to TAA. A new class of tumor antigens has recently been described, the neo-antigens that are created by point mutations of tumor expressing proteins and are recognized by the immune system as non-self. Neo-antigens exhibit two main properties: they are not involved in the immune self-tolerance process and are immunogenic. However, the majority of the neo-antigens are patient specific and their use as cancer vaccines requires their previous identification in each patient individualy that can be done only in highly specialized research centers. It is therefore evident that neoantigens cannot be used for patient vaccination worldwide. This raises the question of whether we can find neoantigen like vaccines, which would not be patient specific. In this review we show that optimized cryptic peptides from TAA are neo-antigen like peptides. Optimized cryptic peptides are recognized by the immune system as nonself because they target self-cryptic peptides that escape self-tolerance; in addition they are strongly immunogenic because their sequence is modified in order to enhance their affinity for the HLA molecule. The first vaccine based on the optimized cryptic peptide approach, Vx-001, which targets the widely expressed tumor antigen telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), has completed a large phase I clinical study and is currently being tested in a randomized phase II trial in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. © Annals of Translational Medicine.},

	abstract = {Background. Malignant transformation of cells is associated with the change in their carbohydrate antigens. Sialyl‐Lewisx (SLEX) is a necroinflammation‐associated carbohydrate antigen (NICA) of liver cells, because it is newly expressed in chronic inflammatory liver diseases. The authors addressed whether this type of carbohydrate antigen shows cancer‐associated changes. Methods. Expression of SLEX and its related structures was studied immunohistochemically using the well characterized monoclonal antibodies in 13 small and 6 advanced hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Results. SLEX was negative in 7 small HCC, which were well differentiated histologically. Both negative and positive cells were observed in 6 other small HCC. When positive, SLEX was expressed membranously or cytoplasmically. The membrane positive HCC cells were well differentiated. Cytoplasmic expression was observed in the less differentiated cells. The SLEX‐negative cells were associated with any degree of differentiation. In six advanced HCC, the expression of SLEX could also be correlated with their histologic differentiation. HCC expressed sialyl‐type 2 chain N‐acetyllactosamine (2‐NAcLc), but not 2‐NAcLc, Lewisx, and Lewisy. Conclusions. SLEX, a NICA, showed HCC‐associated changes that were dependent on the levels of HCC cell differentiation. Suppression and reactivation of α1‐3fucosyl‐transferase was a possible enzymatic basis for the observed changes. Copyright © 1994 American Cancer Society},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The INTERCEPT Blood System (Baxter Healthcare Corp., and Cerus Corp.) is a photochemical treatment (PCT) process that uses amotosalen (S-59) and ultraviolet A (UVA) illumination to inactivate a broad spectrum of pathogens. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To evaluate the potential of the process to create neoantigens, the amounts of residual amotosalen and photoproducts present in PCT platelets (PLTs) and PCT plasma were quantified. The initial amount of amotosalen was 150 micromol per L. After illumination with 3 J per cm2 UVA and before transfusion, a compound adsorption device was used to substantially reduce the amounts of free amotosalen and unreactive photodegradation products. Patient serum samples from Phase III clinical trials were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies to potential amotosalen neoantigens. RESULTS: After PCT, 15 percent of the starting amount of amotosalen remains bound to PLTs, and 15 to 22 percent remains bound to plasma components. The majority of bound amotosalen is associated with lipid. Less than 1 percent of PLT-bound amotosalen and approximately 2 percent of plasma-bound amotosalen can be extracted into the water-soluble protein fraction. In seven Phase III clinical trials, 523 patients received more than 8000 units of PCT PLTs or PCT plasma. None of the patients exhibited clinical or laboratory manifestations of neoantigenicity. Furthermore, no other alteration of PLT membrane proteins was identified based on testing for lymphocytotoxic antibodies and PLT-specific alloantibodies. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that no neoantigens were detected by ELISA after PCT, suggesting that transfusion of PCT PLTs or PCT plasma does not induce adverse immunologic responses.},

	abstract = {Human cancers express organ-specific neoantigens (OSNs) which elicit specific cellular immune responses in the cancer patient, as demonstrated by leukocyte adherence inhibition (LAI), an in vitro immune response assay. A purified protein of MW 40,000 (p40) exhibiting OSN (colon specific) activity was cleaved into specific peptide fragments and their partial amino acid sequences determined. This information was used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to obtain a 992 bp cDNA clone (PCR-992) from a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (LS-180). By comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of PCR-992 with the known sequence of p40 peptides, PCR-992 was shown to correspond to almost the entire coding region of p40. Nucleotide sequence analysis suggested that the protein was mycoplasmal in origin due to its high A + T content (76%) and the presence of five in frame TGA termination codons; at least two of the latter are actually read as tryptophan, a known feature of mycoplasma translation. We have confirmed this origin by direct isolation of a contaminating mycoplasma species from the LS-180 cell line and demonstration that it could be hybridized with the PCR-992 probe. Northern and PCR analysis of RNA preparations from the contaminated LS-180 cell line showed that p40 was part of the high affinity transport system operon of Mycoplasma hyorhinis (Dudler et al, EMBO J., 7: 3963–3970, 1988). Total protein lysates of Mycoplasma hyorhinis cultivated without animal cells could elicit positive LAI responses when incubated with cancer patient leukocytes but not with normal patient leukocytes. The organ-specific nature of the response was, however, not observed indicating that host cell-mycoplasmal interactions may play a role in determining the organ-specific nature of p40 seen with the LAI. The significance of these findings will be discussed in the context of previous thinking regarding the origin of OSNs. © 1993, Center For Academic Publications Japan. All rights reserved.},

Urinary organ-specific antigen as detected by BAC 18.1 was significantly greater in 29 cancer patients (A405:0.717±0.500) vs 27 controls [0.121 ±0.273 (P<0.05)]. Considerable overlap of binding of BAC 18.1 was observed in the colonic effluent of patients with CRC (N=13), adenomas (N=26), inflammatory bowel disease (N=8), or having a normal colonoscopic examination (N=24). CEA levels (nanograms per milliliter) were significantly elevated in the effluent samples of patients with a past history of colorectal cancer, as compared to that of normal individuals (P<0.05). The presence of the Mr 30,000 organ-specific neoantigen in colonic effluent was also demonstrated by western blot. Organ-specific neoantigen originates in the colon and is excreted into the urine, so the BAC 18.1 binding levels in the urine may be a diagnostic aid for CRC. © 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Two strategies for selecting neoantigens as targets for non-small cell lung cancer vaccines were compared: (1) an "off-The-shelf" approach starting with shared mutations extracted from global databases and (2) a personalized pipeline using whole-exome sequencing data on each patient's tumor. Methods: The Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer database was used to create a list of shared missense mutations occurring in more than 1% of patients. These mutations were then assessed for predicted binding affinity to HLA alleles of 15 lung cancer patients, and potential neoantigens (pNeoAgs) for each patient were selected on this basis. In the personalized approach, pNeoAgs were selected from missense mutations detected by whole-exome sequencing of the patient's own samples. Results: The list of shared mutations included 22 missense mutations for adenocarcinoma and 18 for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), resulting in a median of 10 off-The-shelf pNeoAgs for each adenocarcinoma (range 5-13) and 9 (range 5-12) for each SCC. In contrast, a median of 59 missense mutations were identified by whole-exome sequencing (range 33-899) in adenocarcinoma and 164.5 (range 26-232) in SCC. This resulted in a median of 46 pNeoAgs (range 13-659) for adenocarcinoma and 95.5 (range 10-145) for SCC in the personalized set. We found that only one or two off-The-shelf pNeoAgs were included in the set of personalized pNeoAgs-and then in only three patients, with no overlap seen in the remaining 12 patients. Conclusions: Use of an off-The-shelf pipeline is feasible but may not be satisfactory for most patients with non-small cell lung cancer. We recommend identifying personal mutations by comprehensive genome sequencing for developing neoantigen-Targeted cancer immunotherapies. © 2015 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

	abstract = {Better understanding of tolerance and autoimmunity toward melanocyte-specific Ags is needed to develop effective treatment for vitiligo and malignant melanoma; yet, a systematic assessment of these mechanisms has been hampered by the difficulty in tracking autoreactive T cells. To address this issue, we have generated transgenic mice that express hen egg lysozyme as a melanocyte-specific neoantigen. By crossing these animals to a hen egg lysozyme-specific CD4 TCR transgenic line we have been able to track autoreactive CD4+ T cells from their development in the thymus to their involvement in spontaneous autoimmune disease with striking similarity to human vitiligo vulgaris and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome. Our findings show that CD4-dependent destruction of melanocytes is partially inhibited by blocking Fas-Fas ligand interactions and also highlights the importance of local control of autoimmunity, as vitiligo remains patchy and never proceeds to confluence even when Ag and autoreactive CD4+ T cells are abundant. Immune therapy to enhance or suppress melanocyte-specific T cells can be directed at a series of semiredundant pathways involving tolerance and cell death.

	abstract = {Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a highly malignant tumor which usually is diagnosed in advanced stages due to its asymptomatic course of tumorigenesis. Current therapeutic modalities are not effective enough and the 5-year survival rate of the disease is still very low which prompts the urgent need for finding novel efficient therapeutic methods. In this study, we evaluated ex vivo immune response of ESCC patients against our newly designed chimeric construct consisting of highly immunogenic cancer-testis antigens. After confirming effective expression of the in vitro transcribed chimeric mRNA in ex vivo electroporated dendritic cells (DCs) of the ESCC patients, the patients’ CTLs were primed by DCs and cytotoxicity assay was performed to evaluate how the primed CTLs can recognize and target the chimeric mRNA-loaded cells. The chimeric protein was strongly expressed relative to the housekeeping gene expression in electroporated cells. The cytotoxicity of the CTLs was significantly higher in DCs loaded with chimeric mRNAs compared to mock DCs (p < 0.05) in all of the tested ESCC patients. We are introducing a novel construct that our functional study showed can stimulate and induce an effective immune response in ESCC patients. The designed chimeric mRNA-loaded DCs are capable of priming CTLs effectively and induce cytotoxicity against tumor. Therefore, loading DCs with chimeric epitopes of highly immunogenic antigens, such as cancer-testis antigens, are potentially interesting and effective therapeutic modalities for immunotherapy of ESCC. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The surface expression of the epitope recognized by this autoantibody, 5E5, increases with time as platelets age in vitro, suggesting that it may represent a senescence or activation-specific antigen. 5E5 binds to the purified platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa complex in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In an immunoblot technique, 5E5 binds to a protein with an apparent mol wt of 95,000, which is identical to that of GPIIIa under nonreduced conditions. In crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE), the predominant antigen recognized by 5E5 is contained in the GPIIb-IIIa precipitin arc. An additional precipitin arc recognized by 5E5 is often observed only on gels derived from lysates of platelets stored under blood bank conditions for >3 days. These findings illustrate the usefulness of human monoclonal antibodies for the identification of membrane neoantigens expressed as a result of platelet activation or revealed as platelets age in vitro.},

	abstract = {C9 neoantigen immunoreactivity has been found to colocalize with C3 immunoreactivity at the dermal‐epidermal junction zone (DEZ) in skin specimens from patients with bullous pemphigoid, lupus erythematosus and dermatitis herpetiformis. The present study was designed to elucidate whether the C9 neoantigen immunoreactivity represents deposition of membrane attack complexes or non‐lytic SC5b‐9 complexes. Skin specimens from 11 patients with pemphigoid, five patients with discoid lupus erythematosus and from nine patients with dermatitis herpetiformis were studied with immunofluorescence using both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against C9 neoantigen and against vitronectin (S‐protein), an inhibitor to the membrane attack complex of complement. Specimens from the pemphigoid patients demonstrated C9 neoantigen reactivity along the DEZ without detectable colocalized vitronectin. This suggests deposition of membrane attack complexes in the pemphigoid lesions. Immunoreactivity of both C9 neoantigen and vitronectin was detected in the DEZ in specimens of discoid lupus erythematosus and in the tips of dermal papillae in specimens of dermatitis herpetiformis. The combined presence of C9 neoantigen‐ and vitronectin immunoreactivity may indicate deposition of C9 as part of the non‐lytic SC5b‐9 complex. The finding reported here of differential deposition of vitronectin and C9 in different diseases indicates that the presence of C9 neoantigen immunoreactivity in tissue per se does not represent the deposition of membrane attack complexes, but that it may also be C9 deposited as part of the nonlytic SC5b‐9 complex.

Eight out of 30 biopsies for patients with lichenoid lesions had linear C3 deposition at the basement membrane zone (BMZ); four of these patients had bullae and fulfilled the criteria for lichen planus pemphigoides. C9n immunoreactivity was detected as a linear or an intermittent linear/granular band at the BMZ only in these four patients, suggesting a role for the membrane attack complex of complement (MAC) in the pathogenesis of blister formation in lichen planus pemphigoides. Faint linear deposition of vitronectin, in addition to C9n, at the BMZ was seen in two of the four cases of lichen planus pemphigoides and three of six cases of bullous pemphigoid. This suggests that vitronectin may be deposited in association with C9n not only as part of the non-lytic SC5b-9 complex, but also as a regulatory step following the lytic action of MAC. A regulatory function for vitronectin in limiting tissue damage following activation of MAC is supported by our findings of a heavy deposition of vitronectin in association with C9n in a lichen planus pemphigoides patient in whom bulla formation had ceased.},

	abstract = {In carcinogen-driven cancers, a high mutational burden results in neoepitopes that can be recognized immunologically. Such carcinogen-induced tumors may evade this immune response through “immunoediting,” whereby tumors adapt to immune pressure and escape T cell–mediated killing. Many tumors lack a high neoepitope burden, and it remains unclear whether immunoediting occurs in such cases. Here, we evaluated T cell immunity in an autochthonous mouse model of pancreatic cancer and found a low mutational burden, absence of predicted neoepitopes derived from tumor mutations, and resistance to checkpoint immunotherapy. Spontaneous tumor progression was identical in the presence or absence of T cells. Moreover, tumors arising in T cell–depleted mice grew unchecked in immune-competent hosts. However, introduction of the neoantigen ovalbumin (OVA) led to tumor rejection and T cell memory, but this did not occur in OVA immune-tolerant mice. Thus, immunoediting does not occur in this mouse model — a likely consequence, not a cause, of absent neoepitopes. Because many human tumors also have a low missense mutational load and minimal neoepitope burden, our findings have clinical implications for the design of immunotherapy for patients with such tumors. © 2016 American Society for Clinical Investigation.

We have demonstrated that forms of huCRP which preferentially express neo-huCRP antigenicity are naturally present on the surface of both normal human peripheral blood B lymphocytes and lymphocytes with natural killer cell activity. We have also reported that forms of huCRP expressing the neo-huCRP antigen have potent in vitro activities in platelet, polymorphonuclear leukocyte, and monocyte assays. In this study, we demonstrate a rabbit-CRP (raCRP) neoantigen can be expressed when isolated PC-binding raCRP is modified in analogy to huCRP. This "neo-raCRP" is cross-reactive with the neo-huCRP antigen and occurs naturally in acute phase but not normal rabbit liver and muscle. The relative distribution and localization of both antigens were comparable in tissue sections taken at 24 and 48 hr postinflammation elicited with typhoid vaccine. These data support the concept that CRP molecules expressing a structure and antigenicity which are distinct from native, pentagonal CRP do occur in vivo, and that such molecules accumulate at tissue sites of inflammation and necrosis. © 1988.},

The terminal diglycosyl unit of the M. tuberculosis product was synthesized and converted to a corresponding neoglycoprotein, the O-(2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-α-L-fucopyranosyl)-(1→3)-O-α-L- rhamnopyranosyl)-(1→9)-oxynonanoyl-bovine serum albumin, and applied, in ELISA, to sera from individuals with tuberculosis. Although the correlation coefficient between the synthetic product and the native glycolipid was excellent, the seroreactivity rate of tuberculous sera was disappointing; only 24 of 119 sera from tuberculosis patients showed evidence of anti-glycolipid antibodies. In isolates of M. tuberculosis from tuberculosis patients the glycolipid was present in only 1 of 11. A partially deglycosylated version was present in two other isolates; however, most isolates lacked the glycolipid. Accordingly, while the results, unlike those of others, do not portend a future for this form of serodiagnosis in the management of tuberculosis, they offer intriguing hints as to the basis of the variable immunogenicity and pathogenicity of strains of M. tuberculosis.},

	abstract = {PROBLEM: Human endometrium expresses complement components, receptors, and regulatory proteins, many of which appear to be expressed in a hormone‐dependent manner. Whether terminal complement components are also present in the endometrium is unknown. CD59, a broadly expressed protein that blocks association of C9 with C8 in the membrane attack complex, is localized in reproductive tissue to human spermatozoa, seminal plasma, amniotic fluid, and placenta. The present study examines human endometrium for the presence of CD59 and terminal complement proteins. METHOD: Endometrial biopsies were obtained from six normal women from various phases of the menstrual cycle and analyzed by immunohistochemistry, using MEM‐43 anti‐human CD59 and anti‐human SC5b‐9 murine monoclonal antibodies and the immunoperoxidase technique. RESULTS: Both CD59 protein and SC5b‐9 (C9 neoantigen) were demonstrated to be present in endometrial glandular epithelium throughout the menstrual cycle. No specific staining was demonstrated in the stromal compartment. CONCLUSION: CD59 protein and terminal complement proteins are expressed in glandular epithelial cells of normal human endometrium, in both proliferative and luteal phases, suggesting that expression is not hormonally dependent. These analyses further support the presence of a functionally active complement system in normal human endometrium. 1995 Munksgaard},

	abstract = {Background The success of cancer immunotherapies has highlighted the potent ability of local adaptive immune responses to eradicate cancer cells by targeting neoantigens generated by somatic alterations. However, how these factors interact to drive the natural history of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is not well understood. Objective To investigate the role of immune regulation in MIBC disease progression, we performed massively parallel T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs), in silico neoantigen prediction from exome sequences, and expression analysis of immune-related genes. Design, setting, and participants We analyzed 38 MIBC tissues from patients who underwent definitive surgery with a minimum clinical follow-up of 2 yr. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was determined. TCR diversity was quantified using Simpson's diversity index. The main analyses involved the Mann-Whitney U test, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazards models. Results and limitations Low TCRβ chain diversity, correlating with oligoclonal TIL expansion, was significantly correlated with longer RFS, even after adjustment for pathologic tumor stage, node status, and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio 2.67, 95% confidence interval 1.08–6.60; p = 0.03). Patients with both a high number of neoantigens and low TCRβ diversity had longer RFS compared to those with fewer neoantigens and high TCR diversity (median RFS 275 vs 30 wk; p = 0.03). Higher expression of immune cytolytic genes was associated with nonrecurrence among patients with low TCR diversity or fewer neoantigens. Limitations include the sample size and the inability to distinguish CD8+ and CD4+ T cells using TCR sequencing. Conclusions These findings are the first to show that detailed tumor immune-genome analysis at definitive surgery can identify molecular patterns of antitumor immune response contributing to better clinical outcomes in MIBC. Patient summary We discovered that clonal expansion of certain T cells in tumor tissue, possibly targeting cancer-specific antigens, contributes to prevention of bladder cancer recurrence. © 2015 European Association of Urology},

	abstract = {We recently reported that the spleen focus-forming virus [(SFFV), a replication-defective leukemogenic virus] coded for a cell surface neoantigen which could be detected by lymphocyte-mediated cytolysis. Because the SFFV genome has recently been characterized as a recombinant between both ecotropic and xenotropic viral information, we examined whether the SFFV-specific neoantigen, as defined by in vitro cytolysis, shared determinants with antigens coded for by mink cell focus (MCF)-inducing viruses (also xenotropic/ecotropic recombinants). As detected by direct cytolysis of SFFV- and MCF-infected target cells, the SFFV-specific neoantigen was found to be partially cross-reactive with determinants on the surface of MCF virus-infected cells. The cross-reactive determinants appeared to be coded for by the envelope region of both AKR and Moloney MCF viruses, in that antisera specific for MCF gp 70 were capable of blocking SFFV-specific neoantigen-directed cytolysis. These results provide further evidence in support of the recombinant nature of the SFFV genome and its close relationship to MCF viral genetic information. However, in that the SFFV-specific neoantigen was not totally cross-reactive with MCF gp70, it remains possible that additional antigenic determinants associated with SFFV-encoded transformation may be present. © 1979.},

High titer antisera were produced in rabbits against Fg-E (E derived from Fg). The anti-Fg-E sera harvested were absorbed with a cyanogen bromide-activated immunoadsorbent column coupled with intact Fg. The Fg-absorbed antisera were employed to develop a double antibody RIA which detected < 1 ng/ml of Fg-E and exhibited little cross-reactivity of Fg at 1 mg/ml. This Eneo RIA did not discriminate between Fg-E and Fb-E (E derived from Fb) in the competitive inhibition profile, and hence it measured total Eneo antigens. The displacement curves of normal plasmas generally showed a parallel relationship to the standard which permitted the calculation of normal plasma Eneo immunoreactivity (ca. 15 ng/ml). Considerably higher plasma Eneo immunoreactivities have been observed in patients with consumption coagulopathy. Modifications of the Eneo RIA which permit the attainment of this sensitivity are described. © 1979.},

Seventy-four patients with Hodgkin's disease and 31 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were studied from 3 to 186 months after cessation of therapy for lymphoma. Although reactivity to recall antigens and PHA was normal, the number of patients responding to the neoantigens was significantly (P<0.01) lower than normal (KLH, 35%; and DNCB, 34%). This impairment in reactivity to neoantigens could not be correlated with specific diagnosis, stage of disease, or type of treatment. Reactivity to DNCB was significantly (P<0.01) improved in those patients studied more than 3 years after treatment, but the number who reacted was still markedly abnormal (17 of 33). Thus, successfully treated patients with lymphoma seem to have difficulty in responding to new foreign antigens.},

	abstract = {Since complement activation and hematological abnormalities occur in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the present study is an investigation of whether the membrane attack complex of complement might be bound to peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) in vivo. Assembly of the membrane attack complex results in the generation of neoantigen (neoAg) which is complex‐specific and not expressed by any of the individual complement proteins. FITC antiserum specific to neoAg was employed to detect the membrane attack complex on PBL from 7 normal donors, 12 patients with SLE, and 2 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA): 3 ± 1% of normal, 25 ± 13% of SLE, and 23 ± 11% of RA PBL were positive. The majority of the neoAg positive PBL in SLE were polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) as shown by adherence to plastic, phagocytosis of carbonyl iron, and differential cell counts. The PBL were > 98% viable as indicated by the trypan blue exclusion technique. These observations strongly suggest that the membrane attack complex may be bound to viable PBL in patients with SLE and RA, and further raise the possibility that the membrane attack complex may have a function other than lysis.

Human sera from other cancer patients and normal donors contain natural antibody to this antigen. Therefore, this antigen may introduce artifacts in tumor immunology studies in which human sera are tested for serologic reactions against human cells cultured in bovine sera.},

NeoAg was present on 60% of ADCC plaque-forming lymphocytes (PFL). Eight out of 182 neoAg-positive PFL were observed in direct contact with their target cells. In these cases MAC-specific neoAg was visualized at the zone of contact between the cells. Anti-neoAg Ig was found to inhibit ADCC plaque assays up to 62%; and 51Cr-release assays up to 79%. Stimulation of lymphocytes by PHA or mixed lymphocyte culture increased the expression of neoAg. In the case of PHA, increased neoAg expression was correlated with an increased incorporation of 14C-leucine into C5, C6, C7, and C8 antigens, which was detected by immunodiffusion and autoradiography.},
