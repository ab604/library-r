J	Saunders, B				Saunders, Ben			Fetuses are not adult humans: a response to Miller on abortion	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS			English	Editorial Material; Early Access						Abortion - Induced; Ethics; Fetus; Moral Status; Personhood		Miller has recently argued that fetuses have the same inherent value as non-disabled adults. However, we do not need to postulate some property possessed equally by all humans, including fetuses, in order to explain the equality of non-disabled adults. It would suffice if there were some property possessed by all non-disabled adults, but not by fetuses.

The study focused on exploring how inclusion in schools can be promoted through an engagement with student voice. Data analysed involved detailed lesson observations, fieldnotes from meetings between teachers and children, interviews with teachers and children and notes from network meetings. The findings of the study suggest that inclusion can be promoted in schools when (1) a dynamic process of making students heard is employed by: using participatory student voice activities; valuing what students say through a process of dialogue; and moving into actions; and (2) when adult mindsets are open to such ideas and make these mindsets explicit through specific behaviours. The paper concludes by arguing that primary school children are not only able to be engaged in such processes, but more importantly, can throw a different light to collaborative efforts to become more inclusive in schools.

This paper's contribution lies in using agent-based modelling to simulate the effect of the interaction between families' strategies for school selection and two education system characteristics: tracking - a system where students of different academic abilities are separated in different schools - and school accountability - the public availability of information on school quality. The model shows that school tracking and accountability tend to at the same time attenuate and increase school socio-economic segregation, but overall both policies tend to exacerbate segregation by eliciting competition for the best schools. The policy implications are: (i) tracking has a stronger exacerbating effect on segregation than accountability, (ii) the two polices interact to create compounding effects and (iii) by reducing residential segregation between families the segregating effect on schools of the two policies diminishes dramatically.

MEDICAL HUMANITIES			English	Article; Early Access						disability; sociology; Politics; Neurology; Medical humanities	AUTISM	Neurodiversity has come hugely to the fore in recent years in a variety of contexts, and is now subject to academic debate, activist discussion, and increasingly embedded in a range of institutional and corporate settings in the Global North, from workplaces to early years education, from psychotherapy to mainstream political discourses. The term has gained traction in Medical Humanities, as well as debate within bioethics, philosophy of psychology, and of law. Institutionally, it is now relied on in therapeutic practice, autism service provision, as well as in higher education, in particular. In this conceptual article we examine what is at stake in these usages and the implications in need of scrutiny. We resituate neurodiversity in relation to questions of disability by examining the deployment of neurology as the basis for identity, rights and benefits. The emergence of the term and the understandings to which it gives rise, we argue, leave out urgent questions of what is at stake for disabled people in a political climate of increasing harshness and ableism.

Scalable Large-Area 2D-MoS<sub>2</sub>/Silicon-Nanowire Heterostructures for Enhancing Energy Storage Applications	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						2D materials; energy storage; MoS2; nanowires; scalable; TMD	MOS2 THIN-FILMS; MONOLAYER MOS2; NANOWIRES; GROWTH; SCALE	Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides have shown great potential for energy storage applications owing to their interlayer spacing, large surface area-to-volume ratio, superior electrical properties, and chemical compatibility. Further, increasing the surface area of such materials can lead to enhanced electrical, chemical, and optical response for energy storage and generation applications. Vertical silicon nanowires (SiNWs), also known as black-Si, are an ideal substrate for 2D material growth to produce high surface-area heterostructures, owing to their ultrahigh aspect ratio. Achieving this using an industrially scalable method paves the way for next-generation energy storage devices, enabling them to enter commercialization. This work demonstrates large surface area, commercially scalable, hybrid MoS2/SiNW heterostructures, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, with high tunability of the MoS2 layers down to the monolayer scale and conformal MoS2 growth, parallel to the silicon nanowires, as verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This has been achieved using a two-step atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, allowing MoS2 to be grown directly onto the silicon nanowires without any damage to the substrate. The ALD cycle number accurately defines the layer number from monolayer to bulk. Introducing an ALD alumina (Al2O3) interface at the MoS2/SiNW boundary results in enhanced MoS2 quality and uniformity, demonstrated by an order of magnitude reduction in the B/A exciton photoluminescence (PL) intensity ratio to 0.3 and a reduction of the corresponding layer number. This high-quality layered growth on alumina can be utilized in applications such as for interfacial layers in high-capacity batteries or for photocathodes for water splitting. The alumina-free 100 ALD cycle heterostructures demonstrated no diminishing quality effects, lending themselves well to applications that require direct electrical contact with silicon and benefit from more layers, such as electrodes for high-capacity ion batteries.

Requirements analysis methods rely on the expertise and experience of human intervention to make critical judgements. While human judgement is essential to an analysis method, it is also important to ensure a degree of formality so that we reason about safety and security at early stages of analysis and design, rather than detect problems later. In this paper, we present a hierarchical and incremental analysis process that aims to justify the design and flow-down of derived critical requirements arising from safety hazards and security vulnerabilities identified at the system level. The safety and security analysis at each level uses STPA-style action analysis to identify hazards and vulnerabilities. At each level, we verify that the design achieves the safety or security requirements by backing the analysis with formal modelling and proof using Event-B refinement. The formal model helps to identify hazards/vulnerabilities arising from the design and how they relate to the safety accidents/security losses being considered at this level. We then re-apply the same process to each component of the design in a hierarchical manner. Thus, we use hazard and vulnerability analysis, together with refinement-based formal modelling and verification, to drive the design, replacing the system level requirements with component requirements. In doing so, we decompose critical system-level requirements down to component-level requirements, transforming them from abstract system level requirements, towards concrete solutions that we can implement correctly so that the hazards/vulnerabilities are mitigated.

Closures of internal borders in federal countries, such as Canada, raise independent concerns regarding who can close internal borders when. Those questions are not exhausted by rights-based considerations and cannot be resolved using brute empirical measures. They instead implicate the nature and ends of federalism. This text uses the case of internal border restrictions in Canada during COVID-19 to explore whether the kinds of closures that took place there can be justified on federalism grounds. It argues that the case for provinces being able to unilaterally enact interprovincial border closures in federal countries, as observed in Canada during COVID-19, do not withstand scrutiny. It attends to possible justifications for federalism to demonstrate that the best arguments for federalism do not support provincial control over borders that justify provinces possessing, let alone exercising, unilateral authority to close interprovincial borders to persons residing in other provinces. Les questions relatives a la fermeture des frontieres en cas de pandemie sont souvent centrees sur les frontieres internationales ou sur des considerations liees aux droits fondamentaux. La fermeture des frontieres interieures au sein des etats federaux, comme le Canada, souleve toutefois d'autres questionnements sur les enjeux de competences, notamment a savoir qui peut fermer les frontieres interieures et a quel moment. Ces questions ne se limitent pas aux considerations fondees sur les droits fondamentaux et ne peuvent etre resolues par des mesures empiriques brutes. Elles se rapportent plutot a des interrogations sur la nature et les objectifs du federalisme. Dans cette voie, ce texte utilise le cas des restrictions aux frontieres interieures du Canada pendant la COVID-19 pour se demander si ce type de fermeture peut etre justifie par le biais du federalisme. Cet article soutient que les arguments en faveur de la possibilite pour les provinces de decreter unilateralement des fermetures de frontieres interprovinciales dans les etats federaux, comme cela a ete observe au Canada pendant la COVID-19, ne resistent pas a un examen minutieux. En particulier, cet article examine les diverses justifications du federalisme pour demontrer que les meilleurs arguments en faveur de ce regime ne soutiennent pas un controle des frontieres par les provinces, tout comme ils recusent l'idee que les provinces se revendiquent et utilisent un pouvoir unilateral pour fermer les frontieres interprovinciales aux personnes residant dans les autres provinces.

After analysing the behaviour of scalar field modes on hyperbolic slices of Minkowski and performing the holographic renormalisation for the associated onshell action, we obtain a holography dictionary between the bulk theory and the corresponding dual theory on the celestial sphere. We propose that a single scalar field in the bulk is dual to two series of operators on the celestial sphere; the scaling dimension of these operators takes values on the principal series. The real time features of the bulk theory, such as the dynamical and the casual structure, are encoded in the construction of correlation functions on the boundary via the coefficients of the bulk modes. Moreover, we will see that the two series of operators can be interpreted as ingoing and outgoing waves in the bulk. We illustrate our dictionary with the example of a single shock wave. Our results lay foundations for further computation within the flat/celestial CFT correspondence.

J	Valgarosson, VO				Valgarosson, Viktor Orri			The recession generation? Age-period-cohort dynamics of political trust in six countries severely affected by the 2008 crisis	FRONTIERS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						political trust; generations; socialization; age-period-cohort analysis; public opinion	INTRINSIC ESTIMATOR APPROACH; ASSESSING VALIDITY; APPLICATION SCOPE; ECONOMIC-PERFORMANCE; NATIONAL DEMOCRACY; TURNOUT DECLINE; MIXED MODELS; LIFE-CYCLE; YANG; CONFIDENCE	A potential puzzle has emerged in the study of political trust: recent studies indicate that individuals' trust judgements are remarkably stable over their life course, but many other studies have observed long-term declines of trust in the aggregate. In particular, trust clearly declined substantially during and following the 2008 economic (and political) crisis in many European countries severely affected by it: especially Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In this study, I focus on these countries and ask to what extent the crisis may have resulted in a "recession generation" of citizens who were in their formative years at the time and may have adopted less trusting political orientations that have persisted since, more or less independent of life-cycle and period effects. To answer this question, I present descriptive visualizations of trust levels by citizens' age over time and conduct statistical age-period-cohort (APC) analysis of political trust levels using generalized additive models (GAMs) on data from the Eurobarometer (1997-2022) and the European Values Study/World Values Survey (EVS/WVS). The findings are inconclusive: descriptive comparisons of age-by-year diagonals suggest this cohort of citizens may indeed have lower levels of trust than older and younger cohorts, above and beyond the effects of life cycle and period-but the results from GAMs differ between countries and data sources and only show the expected cohort effect in three cases. These tentative results have implications for our understanding of the nature of political trust judgements and the potential socializing effects of major political events on citizens attitude-formation, but they await confirmation in future studies which will have the benefit of longer-term data and potentially further innovations in APC analysis.

Following a recent encounter, this review article is aimed to remind the reader about its occurrence, clinical manifestations, differential diagnoses, and management options.Case summary A 3-month-old baby underwent successful surgical repair of a large ventricular septal defect. Intraoperative epicardial echocardiogram at the end of the case demonstrated an unexpected left atrial mass, raising suspicion of a thrombus adjacent to the mitral valve. Urgent re-establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass and exploration of the left atrium did not reveal a thrombus, but this was subsequently identified as an iLAA. This completely resolved after manual external reduction of the appendage.Discussion Published literature is confined to case reports only, with most cases observed post-operatively, but some occurring spontaneously. Awareness of this unusual manifestation is particularly important in the intraoperative period as it can usually be addressed without the need for further cardiopulmonary bypass.

A systematic review of the literature	PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOTHERAPY-THEORY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Review; Early Access						attachment; auditory hallucinations; dissociation; paranoia; psychosis; systematic review; voice hearing	ADULT ATTACHMENT; CHILDHOOD TRAUMA; STYLE; SELF; HALLUCINATIONS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; CONTINUUM; PRONENESS; SYMPTOMS; VALIDITY	PurposeInsecure attachment may constitute a vulnerability factor for psychosis, and dissociation may be a key mechanism in the development of auditory hallucinations specifically. While there is good evidence for the role of these processes in isolation, it is unclear whether dissociation accounts for the association between insecure attachment and psychosis. This systematic review takes a theory-driven approach to examine proposed causal relationships across the clinical and nonclinical literature.MethodsWe searched five databases (PubMeD, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL and ETHOS) for published and unpublished research examining attachment, dissociation and psychosis. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality of all included studies.ResultsWe identified 242 potential articles and included 13 in the final review (2096 participants). We found that (1) disorganised attachment was consistently associated with dissociation and inconsistently associated with voices and paranoia, (2) dissociation was associated with voices and paranoia, and these links were stronger in clinical samples, and (3) dissociation played a role in the impact of insecure attachment on voice hearing and paranoia in clinical groups.ConclusionsThis is the first review to synthesise the research examining attachment, dissociation, and psychosis. The evidence is consistent with proposed causal hypotheses and raises conceptual and measurement issues, for example, the need to clarify the relative contributions of different insecure attachment styles, and utilise behavioural/observational measures to strengthen study designs. Most importantly, we need experimental and longitudinal studies to confirm causal links and targets for treatment.

The study utilises a student engagement scale which was previously used with undergraduate students in Australian universities. Our findings provide insights on five dimensions of student engagement including academic, intellectual, peer, student-staff and online engagement which were explored during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings indicate that the Student-Staff Engagement scale obtained the highest mean value, and the Academic Engagement Scale acquired the lowest score. The highest and lowest engagement-scale items in this study illustrates the shifting profile of first-year students who demonstrated contrasting study habits, forms of communication with peers and interactions with university staff to pre-pandemic students. The results also indicate that engagement is a complex concept and further work is required to better understand student engagement within contemporary universities which have embraced a hybrid mode of teaching and learning. The paper calls for a more robust theorising of the engagement concept and the authors of this article argue that the online dimension of student engagement requires expanding to mirror the experiences of undergraduates studying in the hybrid university.

Effects of salt concentration on top wall bubble injection in a turbulent channel flow: bubble dynamics and wall drag reduction	EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS			English	Article							SKIN-FRICTION; BOUNDARY-LAYER; FRESH-WATER; COALESCENCE; AIR; ELECTROLYTES; TRANSITION; SINGLE; MODEL; LADEN	Most applications related to bubble drag reduction (BDR) occur in contaminated environments where the presence of different surface active agents modify bubble coalescence and hence, affect flow drag. Although there have been studies on bubble drag modifications with salt/surfactant, the effects of systematic variation in salt/surfactant concentration on bubble dynamics and drag remain relatively unexplored. Driven by this motivation, in the present work, we experimentally investigate the effects of salt concentration on the bubble dynamics and drag modification in a fully developed horizontal turbulent channel flow for top wall bubble injection, over a wide range of salt concentrations (0<M<0.08\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$0<M<0.08$$\end{document}, moles/litre), channel Reynolds number (22,500<Re<65,000\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$22{,}500<\text{Re}<65{,}000$$\end{document}), and injected bubble void fraction (0<alpha<0.16\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$0<\alpha <0.16$$\end{document}). The injected bubbles interact with the flow in the turbulent channel and as they move downstream reach an equilibrium state between the bubbly phase and the fully developed carrier phase that persists further downstream. The equilibrium state of the bubble dynamics is captured by high-speed visualizations and the corresponding drag is obtained from stream-wise pressure drop measurements within the channel. Increasing salt concentration levels is seen to lead to reduction in bubble coalescence and consequently in bubble size that modifies bubble deformability, migration, and distribution near the top wall, with the changes being dependent on the Re and alpha\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\alpha$$\end{document} values.

The reduction in bubble sizes with salt addition leads to an increase in drag with salt concentration, which saturates beyond a critical salt concentration (MCritical\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$M_\text{Critical}$$\end{document}). With increasing Re, due to the smaller time available for coalescence, the bubbles are relatively small even in the absence of salt and hence, the bubble dynamics is found to be less susceptible to modifications by the addition of salt, unlike at low Re, and hence, results in a smaller increase in drag and a lower MCritical\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$M_\text{Critical}$$\end{document}. At the largest Re of about 65,000, both the bubble dynamics and drag are found to be very similar in both the no-salt and salt cases indicating that MCritical approximate to 0\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$M_\text{Critical}\approx 0$$\end{document}. The present observations suggest that at low Re, the bubble dynamics aspects and flow modifications would be very different between salt water and fresh water conditions, whereas at large Re, the differences would be minimal. The present results can thus help deepen our understanding of bubbly flow applications in contaminated environments, such as those that occur in bubble-induced drag reductions in ships and pipelines.

EPA and DHA are sourced mainly from fish, which is not sustainable. This review explores alternative sustainable sources.Recent findingsRecent research confirms that higher intake and status of EPA and DHA are associated with health benefits including lower risk of incident type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease mortality. Meta-analyses confirm benefits of intravenous EPA and DHA in hospitalized adults. Algal oils and seed oils from some genetically modified (GM) plants are sources of EPA and DHA. An oil from GM camelina showed equivalence with fish oil in human trials. Ahiflower oil, a source of stearidonic acid, had biological effects in experimental studies that might translate into health benefits. An intravenous lipid emulsion based on Ahiflower oil has been tested in experimental research. Pine nut oil (PNO) is a source of pinolenic acid, which is not an omega-3 PUFA but has similar actions.SummaryAlgal oils, oils from GM seed crops, Ahiflower oil and other sources of stearidonic acid, and nonomega-3 oils including PNO, are plant-sourced sustainable alternatives to fish-sourced VLC omega-3 PUFAs.

In this paper, we both relate to, and extend scholarly work in the domains of AE and social inclusion by investigating the process of AE from an interplay of institutional logics perspective, with an emphasis on the diversity strands to which academic entrepreneurs belong. Drawing on extensive fieldwork of 55 academic researchers affiliated with 6 UK universities, our findings highlight the co-existence of profession, science logic and market logic, combined with the new logics that we introduce-diversity and impact logics-in capturing value through AE for addressing social inclusion. We make an empirical and theoretical contribution by demonstrating the instrumentality of these logics as enablers and constraints on the process of AE. We also advance the theory on logics and AE by demonstrating how the intersection of logics creates different kinds of salient points and pressures for academics and university policy makers. Closely linked to this, we make policy contributions by putting forward policy insights that are bottom-up and tailored based on a thorough understanding of the experiences and views of academic entrepreneurs.

J	Soltani, A; Bajestani, AV				Soltani, Ali; Bajestani, Amirhossein Vahidi			Linear Quadratic Gaussian Control for a Liquid-Carrying Quadrotor	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Quadrotor; Liquid sloshing; Suppressing; LQG control		A quadrotor with a liquid tank may be used in various tasks such as spraying pesticides and firefighting. Therefore, motion of the quadrotor should be controlled such that liquid sloshing is suppressed. To tackle this issue, a LQG controller is proposed in this paper. The LQG controller is based on a linear equivalent mechanical model for liquid sloshing which is presented in this study. The proposed controller uses position and attitude feedback of quadrotor to estimate and control the liquid states. This is different than other controllers presented in the literature where they consider liquid sloshing as an external disturbance. LQG controller is simulated using system's nonlinear equations and compared to a PID controller. The results depicted a 20% improvement in trajectory tracking performance for LQG controller while using 11% less energy than its PID counterpart. Also the LQG control scheme was able to compensate for a constant external disturbance whereas the PID controller was not able to stabilize the system while the constant disturbance is present.

Our objective was to evaluate the outcome of our new technique: Monopolar Transurethral Enucleoresection of the Prostate (TUERP) with apical release (bring it all to centre). Methods: A prospective study of all cases undergoing TUERP at a tertiary centre from January 2020 to October 2022 was performed. Patient demographics, intraoperative variables and postoperative results along with follow-up data were collected. Data of all the cases who had completed a one-year follow-up post-surgery were included and analysed. Results: A total of 240 patients with complete data including a one-year follow-up were included. Mean prostatic volume was 55.3 +/- 11.6 gm, and 28 (11.67%) cases were >100 gm. The mean operative time was 31.7 +/- 7.6, and mean haemoglobin drop at 24 h was 0.73 +/- 1.21 gm/dL. The overall complication rate was 16.67%, with only two (0.83%) Clavien-Dindo III complications (haematuria and clots needing evacuation) and the other complications being Clavien-Dindo I/II complications. Sustained improvement at 1 year of follow-up was noted: Qmax: 25.2 +/- 5.6 mL/s, IPSS: 4.7 +/- 2.5 and PVR: 22.5 +/- 9.6 mL. Conclusions: Monopolar TUERP with a modified Nesbit's enucleoresection with apical release can be considered a promising technique, which needs further studies to be validated with appropriate comparisons.

A review of current literature	ARAB JOURNAL OF UROLOGY			English	Review; Early Access						Ureteroscopy; kidney calculi; elderly; old; outcomes; urolithiasis	TRENDS; UROLITHIASIS; LITHOTRIPSY; PREVALENCE; YOUNG	BackgroundWith the aging of our patient population, and the increasing incidence of kidney stone disease in the elderly, active stone treatment is becoming more common. In this review of current literature, we aim to assess safety and efficacy of ureteroscopy (URS) as primary treatment for urolithiasis in the octogenarians.Materials and methodsA scoping review of literature according to the PRISMA guidelines was performed, using the relevant search terms. Original articles were screened and included. A narrative review of the studies is provided, with emphasis on outcomes of URS in the elderly.Results10 studies were included in the analysis. URS performed in the elderly population showed a good safety and efficacy, with stone-free rates (SFR) comparable to the general population. URS specific complication rates seems to be comparable to the other age groups, with postoperative events mostly related to anaesthesia and pre-existing medical conditions. The overall complication rate was still low, with a slightly prolonged hospital stay. Predictors for SFR were age, severe comorbidities and stone burden.ConclusionURS for stone treatment in the elderly population is safe and effective, with comparable surgical outcomes to that of the general population. As comorbidities play an important role in the fitness for surgery and overall survival, risks and benefit of active stone treatment should be carefully balanced in this group.

Monitoring of leachate levels in the landfill using piezometers located at different discrete levels found water table type conditions to within 10 m of the surface and established a downward hydraulic gradient at an infiltration rate of similar to 400 mm/year. Short-duration falling-head piezometer tests indicated landfill hydraulic conductivities (Kh) between 1x10-4 and 1x10-5 m/s, with a general reduction in K with depth. Several different hypotheses to explain the high pore water pressures in the landfill were investigated using a one-dimensional configuration of the landfill degradation and transport model LDAT. It was assumed that the unsaturated properties of the landfilled wastes can be bounded by two sets of van Genuchten parameters. Comparing the values of Kv required to create a match between observed and modeled leachate heads with the measured Kh values at the site led to a tentative conclusion that landfill-scale anisotropy could be as high as similar to 1 : 1,000. The introduction of a distributed landfill gas (LFG) source term into LDAT at a rate of 0.61 mLFG3 tw-1 year-1, similar to the gassing rate at the site, increased the adopted saturated permeability relationship in LDAT by a factor of between similar to 3 and similar to 7.5 compared with a no-gassing scenario. Introducing even moderate gas generation rates (5.6 mLFG3 tw-1 year-1) into models simulating low infiltration rates of 50 mm/year can result in a significant depth of waste where pore water pressures are more than 1 kPa (10-cm water head). This results in apparent below-water-table type conditions because water will enter piezometers installed into such wastes, even though the gassing reduces the degree of saturation to below one.

J	Yule, L; Harris, N; Hill, M; Zaghari, B				Yule, Lawrence; Harris, Nicholas; Hill, Martyn; Zaghari, Bahareh			Y Temperature Monitoring of Through-Thickness Temperature Gradients in Thermal Barrier Coatings Using Ultrasonic Guided Waves	JOURNAL OF NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION			English	Article						Ultrasonic guided waves; Thermal barrier coatings; Temperature monitoring; Nozzle guide vanes	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; YOUNGS MODULUS; DEFORMATION; POROSITY; HARDNESS; TBCS	Ultrasonic guided waves offer a promising method of monitoring the online temperature of plate-like structures in extreme environments, such as aero-engine nozzle guide vanes (NGVs), and can provide the resolution, response rate, and robust operation that is required in aerospace. Previous investigations have shown the potential of such a system but the effect of the complex physical environment on wave propagation is yet to be considered. This article uses a numerical approach to investigate how thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) applied to the surface of many components designed for extreme thermal conditions will affect ultrasonic guided wave propagation, and how a system can be employed to monitor through-thickness temperature changes. The top coat/bond coat boundary in NGVs has been shown to be a temperature critical point that is difficult to monitor with traditional temperature sensors, which highlights the potential of ultrasonic guided waves. Differences in application method and layer thickness are considered, and analysis of through-thickness displacement profiles and dispersion curves are used to predict signal response and determine the most suitable mode of operation. Heat transfer simulations (COMSOL) have been used to predict temperature gradients within a TBC, and dispersion curves have been produced from the temperature dependant material properties. Time dependant simulations of wave propagation are in good agreement with dispersion curve predictions of wave velocity for the two lowest order modes in three thicknesses of TBC top coat (100, 250, and 500 mu m\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$\upmu \hbox {m}$$\end{document}). When wave velocity measurements from the simulations are compared to dispersion curves generated at isotropic temperatures, the corresponding temperature represents the average temperature of a gradient system well. Such a measurement system could, in principle, be used in conjunction with surface temperature measurement systems to monitor through-thickness temperature changes.

However, the amplitude from such a source is very weak and current gravitational-wave interferometers have yet to witness such a signal. The lack of detections has provided upper limits on the size of the involved deformations, which are continually being constrained. With expected improvements in detector sensitivities and analysis techniques, there is good reason to anticipate an observation in the future. This review concerns the current state of the theory of neutron-star mountains. These exotic objects host the extreme regimes of modern physics, which are related to how they sustain mountains. We summarise various mechanisms that may give rise to asymmetries, including crustal strains built up during the evolutionary history of the neutron star, the magnetic field distorting the star's shape and accretion episodes gradually constructing a mountain. Moving beyond the simple rotating model, we also discuss how precession affects the dynamics and modifies the gravitational-wave signal. We describe the prospects for detection and the challenges moving forward.

The security of SCs has received increasing attention from researchers, due to the emerging risks associated with their distributed nature. The increase in risk in SCs comes from threats that are inherently similar regardless of the type of SC, thus, requiring similar defence mechanisms. Being able to identify the types of threats will help developers to build effective defences.Design/methodology/approachIn this work, we provide an analysis of the threats, possible attacks and traceability solutions for SCs, and highlight outstanding problems. Through a comprehensive literature review (2015-2021), we analysed various SC security solutions, focussing on tracking solutions. In particular, we focus on three types of SCs: digital, food and pharmaceutical that are considered prime targets for cyberattacks. We introduce a systematic categorization of threats and discuss emerging solutions for prevention and mitigation.FindingsOur study shows that the current traceability solutions for SC systems do not offer a broadened security analysis and fail to provide extensive protection against cyberattacks. Furthermore, global SCs face common challenges, as there are still unresolved issues, especially those related to the increasing SC complexity and interconnectivity, where cyberattacks are spread across suppliers.Originality/valueThis is the first time that a systematic categorization of general threats for SC is made based on an existing threat model for hardware SC.

Challenges and expectations of international medical graduates moving to the UK: An online survey	SCOTTISH MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						Medical graduate; GMC; complaint; NHS; mentorship; supervision; international		Introduction International medical graduates (IMGs) account for 41% of the UK doctor's workforce but often work in isolated roles, receive minimal constructive feedback regarding their work and offered limited opportunities for career progression. We conducted a survey researching the views of IMGs or doctors from ethnic minority backgrounds on the support given to them.Methods A survey was carried out on physician demographics, grade and date of first NHS appointment, familiarity and support offered in NHS, induction and study leave, Professional and Linguistic Assessments Board exams and General Medical Council (GMC) referrals. It was drafted via surveymonkey.co.uk platform and circulated via relevant closed medical groups.Results A total of 173 IMGs and 16 British trained doctors (controls) took the survey. In the IMGs first job, there was no dedicated supervisor, mentor, induction, shadowing period and study leave for 56%, 86%, 52%, 59% and 52%, respectively. Suggestions given for improvements included teaching sessions, mentors, work orientation, supernumerary period and paid induction by 80%, 78%, 76%, 61% and 41% respectively. While 59% of participants knew of another IMG referred to the GMC, the primary reasons given were lack of knowledge of NHS, bias, communication difficulties and cultural differences.Conclusion This paper reflects the views of doctors regarding the support given to IMGs during their first NHS appointment and subsequent jobs in the NHS. IMGs require a focused and detailed induction, mentorship, educational and clinical supervision throughout their transition to the NHS.

We highlight the breadth of mechanisms by which lipid droplets may contribute to the progression of SLD with a particular focus on the role of lipid droplets as inducers of mechanical stress within hepatocytes and genetic mutations in lipid droplet associated proteins. Finally, this review provides an update on clinical trials exploring the therapeutic potential and strategies targeting lipid droplets.Recent findingsThe size, composition and location of hepatic lipid droplets strongly influence the pathological role of these organelles in SLD. Emerging studies are beginning to elucidate the importance of lipid droplet induced hepatocyte mechanical stress. Novel strategies targeting lipid droplets, including the effects of lipid droplet associated protein mutations, show promising therapeutic potential.SummaryMuch more than a histological feature, lipid droplets are complex heterogenous organelles crucial to cellular metabolism with important causative roles in the development and progression of SLD. Lipid droplet induced mechanical stress may exacerbate hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis and potentially contribute to the development of a pro-carcinogenic hepatic environment. The integration of advancements in genetics and molecular biology in upcoming treatments aspires to transcend symptomatic alleviation and address the fundamental causes and pathological development of SLD.

The amount of data generated in the context of user experiments can exceed hundreds of gigabits per second, resulting in tens of petabytes stored every year. These rates and volumes pose significant challenges both for facilities and users thereof. In fact, if unaddressed, extraction and interpretation of scientific content will be hindered, and investment and operational costs will quickly become unsustainable. In this article, we outline challenges and solutions in data reduction.

Two membranes encapsulate the aqueous periplasm, which contains the cell wall. Little is known about the mechanisms via which antimicrobial peptides move through the periplasm from the outer membrane to their site of action, the inner membrane. We utilize all-atom molecular dynamics to study two antimicrobial peptides, polymyxins B1 and E, within models of the E. coli periplasm crowded to different extents. In a simple chemical environment, both PMB1 and PME bind irreversibly to the cell wall. The presence of specific macromolecules leads to competition with the polymyxins for cell wall interaction sites, resulting in polymyxin dissociation from the cell wall. Chemical complexity also impacts interactions between polymyxins and Braun's lipoprotein; thus, the interaction modes of lipoprotein antibiotics within the periplasm are dependent upon the nature of the other species present.

These quantities play a crucial role in determining aerodynamic loads and conducting aeroelastic analysis. Angle of attack and Mach number are chosen as the two independent parameters for the reduced-order models. A comparative assessment is conducted between the proposed deep-learning framework and the proper orthogonal decomposition approach to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each method. The accuracy of the data-driven machine-learning method in modeling steady-state transonic aerodynamics is assessed against three benchmark cases of three-dimensional test cases: Benchmark Super Critical Wing and ONERA M6 wings, and the wing-body Common Research Model configuration. Despite the challenges of the analyzed scenarios, promising results are obtained for each test case, showing the effectiveness of the model implemented. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates the application of the method for aeroelastic analysis and uncertainty quantification. This quantifies the robustness and versatility of the implemented model.

An 'I am' Digital Story is a short video (c.6 min) that provides a strengths-based representation of a young person that is designed to be shared with and between settings. The process and outcomes of story cocreation were evaluated through semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders.FindingsThe process of story creation was evaluated very positively by key stakeholders. The information about Dominic's strengths and preferences helped the new setting to prepare for Dominic's arrival.ConclusionsThe 'I am' Digital Story method provides a powerful and accessible method for including the voices of young people with complex communication needs in their transitions. Young people and their families say it can be hard moving from school to adult services. We think young people with complex communication needs should be part of planning for this move. Often, young people with complex communication needs are not part of planning for this move. We have tried a new way for them to be part of the planning. It is called an 'I am' Digital Story. We created an 'I am' Digital Story with Dominic, his mother, his teacher and his speech and language therapist. They told the story of who Dominic is. The story tells people what Dominic likes doing and what Dominic is good at. The story helps people get to know Dominic, even if they cannot meet Dominic. We asked questions after to see if the Digital Story was a good idea. The people who made the Digital Story said it was easy to make the video. The people in adult services said it was a big help to watch the video. We are happy because the Digital Story made Dominic part of planning his move from school to adult services.

Remote semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents of babies. Babies were under 12 months old at time of interview, and parents had perceived unsettled baby behaviours in their first 4 months of life. Interviews were transcribed and data analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.ResultsBased on interviews with 25 mothers, four main themes were developed. 'The need for answers' highlighted parental uncertainty about what constitutes normal baby behaviour, leading to help-seeking from multiple sources. 'The importance of health professionals' and 'Experiencing health professional support' identified perceptions about limited access, communication, mixed advice and how these influenced parental perception/management of behaviours. 'Foundations to help-seeking' highlighted important roles of social support and online help for valued shared experiences, emotional and practical support.ConclusionHealth professional access and advice are important to parents, despite the increasing role of online help and importance of social support. More support and improved access to reliable sources of information is needed for parents.Implications for the Profession and/or Patient CareFindings will inform future research and clinical practice to address parental uncertainties. Qualitative research with front-line health professionals is necessary.ImpactFindings can inform the development of resources to support professionals/families managing unsettled babies.Reporting MethodStandards for Reporting Qualitative Research.Public InvolvementA public contributor was involved throughout all stages of the research. Emerging findings were discussed at a parent group.What does this paper contribute to the wider global clinical community? Addressing parental uncertainties is important; about what is normal, non-pharmacological approaches and when pharmacological intervention is required. A digital information/self-management intervention may be useful for parents/clinicians.

A vessel advancing in such a stratified fluid can generate internal waves between these layers. The generation of internal waves requires energy and thus increases the resistance experienced by the vessel, a phenomenon known as the dead water effect which can result in a severe reduction in speed and loss of steering power. This study uses Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to investigate the increase in ship resistance caused by the dead water effect. The results show that the presence of a stratified flow can increase total resistance approximately sixfold in extreme conditions. At standard operating conditions, total resistance may increase by approximately 6% as a result of flow stratification.

It is typically identified by immunohistochemistry of tissue taken from tumors or through genetic testing with next-generation sequencing. Diagnosing Lynch syndrome becomes more complex when the individual is mosaic for the relevant pathogenic variant. There are very few cases of this reported in the medical literature. It is even more unusual for the diagnosis to be made based on testing of a keratoacanthoma lesion. We report a case where immunohistochemistry of a keratoacanthoma helped make a diagnosis of mosaic Lynch syndrome. We will explore how mosaicism should be considered when a phenotype is strong, even if next-generation sequencing reports no pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant and how lesions such as keratoacanthomas can have a role in the early detection and treatment of future malignancies.

A library of 81 crystal structures is obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database, structural similarities are determined, and energetic preferences are assessed. Two dominant amide-amide hydrogen bond geometries and a molecular stack are frequently observed especially in the para-acetanilide subgroup. In all cases, the amide functional group has a greater effect on the chain geometry and resultant crystal packing than the phenyl substituent. The study concludes with a short review of the polymorphism of paracetamol and suggests an alternative concept for overcoming the compaction issues currently encountered in the manufacture of the oral dosage form.

The research method includes multiple case studies. Qualitative data are collected via interviews and documentation review. Within-case and cross-case analyses of the research lead to 14 propositions and a novel framework, which formalize and link agility and digitalization at different levels. The research findings point out the agility in micro and macro types for the demand and supply sides of the business, responding to different levels of uncertainties. The findings categorize the relevant applications of digitalization at three levels: data interchange, data integration, and predictive data analytics. Moreover, the agility-digitalization relationships are defined for different levels of customization, represented by customer order decoupling points. This paper contributes to the literature by offering an in-depth and explicit understanding of the impacts of digitalization on different types of agility for different levels of customization.

J	Schmitt, C; Singh, B				Schmitt, Christian; Singh, Bismark			Quadratic Optimization Models for Balancing Preferential Access and Fairness: Formulations and Optimality Conditions	INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article; Early Access						quadratic combinatorial optimization; KKT optimality conditions; fairness; waste management; facility location problems	FACILITY LOCATION	Typically, within facility location problems, fairness is defined in terms of accessibility of users. However, for facilities perceived as undesirable by communities hosting them, fairness between the usage of facilities becomes especially important. Limited research exists on this notion of fairness. To close this gap, we develop a series of optimization models for the allocation of populations of users to facilities such that access for users is balanced with a fair utilization of facilities. The optimality conditions of the underlying nonconvex quadratic models state the precise balance between accessibility and fairness. We define new classes of fairness and a metric to quantify the extent to which fairness is achieved in both optimal and suboptimal allocations. We show that a continuous relaxation of our central model is sufficient to achieve a perfect extent of fairness, while a special case reduces to the classical notion of proportional fairness. Our work is motivated by pervasive ecological challenges faced by the waste management community as policymakers seek to reduce the number of recycling centers in the last few years. As a computational case study, applying our models on data for the state of Bavaria in Germany, we find that even after the closure of a moderate number of recycling centers, large degrees of access can be ensured, provided that the closures are conducted optimally. Fairness, however, is impacted more, with facilities in rural regions shouldering larger loads of visiting populations than those in urban regions.

Integral to such automated predictive analysis is a shift in time frames that redraws the relationship between families and the state, to potentially intervene on an anticipatory basis of 'what hasn't happened but might'. In the process, human subjects are reformulated as disembodied objects of data-driven futures. The article explains this process and fills a significant gap in knowledge about parents' views of this development. We draw on group and individual discussions with parents across Great Britain to consider their understanding of predictive analytics and how comfortable they are with it. Parents' concerns focused on inaccuracies in the data used for prediction, the unfair risk of false positives and false negatives, the deterministic implications of the past predicting the future, and the disturbing potential of being positioned in what was a pre-problem space. We conclude with policy implications.

J	Hussain, N; Clark, A; Innes, A				Hussain, Nazmul; Clark, Andrew; Innes, Anthea			Cultural Myths, Superstitions, and Stigma Surrounding Dementia in a UK Bangladeshi Community	HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY			English	Article							ETHNIC-MINORITIES; OLDER-PEOPLE; LIFE	The last three census data highlighted that UK Bangladeshi communities have the worst health outcomes. This includes a higher risk of type two diabetes and heart diseases; both are risk factors for developing vascular dementia. However, little is known about Bangladeshi community members' understandings of dementia, including cultural myths. This paper focuses on the cultural myths, superstitions, and stigma surrounding dementia in an English Bangladeshi community from the direct experiences of people living with dementia, their caregivers, and the views of dementia service providers/stakeholders. This qualitative research was undertaken with three distinct participant groups using semistructured interviews (n = 25), who were recruited from community settings. The first and second participant groups explored the experiences of people with dementia (n = 10) and their family caregivers (n = 10). The third group examined stakeholders'/service providers' views (n = 5). Interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. Findings were reached using an interpretive approach, emphasising the sense people make in their own lives and experiences and how they frame and understand dementia. The study revealed that participants with dementia and their caregivers have "alternative" knowledge about dementia and do not necessarily understand dementia in a Westernised scientific/biomedical context. Misconceptions about dementia and belief in various myths and superstitions can lead people to go to spiritual healers or practice traditional remedies rather than to their GPs, delaying their dementia diagnosis. This paper concludes that there is a lack of awareness among the Bangladeshi participants and a need for targeted awareness about dementia to help dispel cultural myths and combat the stigma surrounding dementia within the Bangladeshi community.

L1 grammatical attrition in late Spanish-English bilinguals in the UK: aspectual interpretations of present tense in Spanish	LANGUAGE LEARNING JOURNAL			English	Article						L1 attrition; aspect; Spanish		This article sheds light on the linguistic and extralinguistic conditions that determine the likelihood of L1 grammatical attrition in late sequential bilinguals. We explore whether aspectual interpretations associated with the present tense may be a vulnerable area for the native grammar of 30 late Spanish-English bilinguals who have settled in the UK for over 15 years. Attrition of this property in L1 Spanish grammars has been reported by Cuza (2010. On the L1 attrition of the Spanish present tense. Hispania 93, no. 2: 256-272. doi:10.1353/hpn.2010.a382874) for Spanish-English bilinguals in the USA and Canada. Our finding of no attrition for UK-based Spanish bilinguals suggests that in Cuza's study, attrition may be mediated by dialectal variation in the L1 in the North American context, where Spanish is a widespread and visible community language. Further, we ascribe the absence of attrition to a specific characteristic of the grammatical distinction between the L1 and L2: where the L2 grammar provides options representing only a subset of the options available to the L1 for the corresponding grammatical property, attrition may be disfavoured.

The aim of Material Testing 2.0 is to capitalise on this and design experimental setups for efficient material characterisation using inverse identification techniques such as the Virtual Fields Method (VFM). In that case, however, a priori knowledge of the constitutive model is required, which sometimes is not a trivial task. This limitation can be overcome by identifying multiple constitutive models using the same DIC strain fields and comparing their performance. In this work, we present a methodology to evaluate model performance and compare different constitutive models based on quantitative metrics. DIC experiments were performed on an S-shaped high density polyethylene test sample under uniaxial load. The heterogeneous DIC strain fields were used in combination with the VFM to identify parameters of hyperelastic constitutive models with increasing complexity. Two deterministic metrics, the equilibrium gap indicator (EGI) and the reconstructed axial force ratio (RAFR), were defined and used to compare the performance of these constitutive models. The impact of spatial smoothing on DIC strain fields was studied by calculating the EGI and RAFR using a digital twin of the DIC experiments. EGI and RAFR metrics provide complementary information regarding the material behaviour, and both are necessary to make an informed choice. In this case study, hyperelastic constitutive models were found not to capture the material stiffness well in the small strain regime. A linear-elastic contribution exponentially decaying with the equivalent shear stress was added to the hyperelastic models and the corresponding model parameters identified using the VFM. The elastic-hyperelastic constitutive models were found to perform better than their purely hyperelastic counterparts.

A three-phase carbon-nanotube (CNT)/polymer/fiber laminated composite is considered where the probable agglomeration of the CNT phase in the nano-matrix mixture is also addressed. Diverse use of fiber phase material in different plies is assumed in the context of hybrid laminated composite. A combination of nanocomposite polymer matrix, tow-steered curvilinear reinforcing fibers within the plies, and hybrid multi-material laminate is considered. The panel flutter behavior of the arbitrary quadrilateral hybrid laminated nanocomposite plate is formulated by a non-uniform rational B-splines-type isogeometric analysis method based on the first-order shear deformation plate theory. The nonideal mixture of the nanocomposite is also concerned about through applying a micromechanics approach. Representative results are obtained and compared with those available in the literature to demonstrate the quality of the proposed formulation. The effects of different parameters including the layup, mixture quality, boundary condition, geometry, and flow direction on the flutter behavior are investigated by performing parametric studies.

Therefore, it has good prospects to be used in nanoelectromechanical resonators for sensitive mass detection. Previously, a graphene resonator with graphene/metal contact able to zeptogram level sensing and a with quality factor of 42 at RT was presented. However, over-etching under the metal contacts degrades the quality factor, and resonators with metal/graphene/metal contacts were fabricated to overcome this issue. A quality factor of 350 at RT was obtained for a device with width = 0.8 mu m and length = 1 mu m. Tunning of the resonance frequency from 9.6 to 13.5 MHz with dc gate bias is demonstrated. Temperature reduction from 300 K to 30 K increased the resonance frequency by about 4-6 MHz. The temperature influence on nonlinearity is also discussed, with a resonator demonstrating softening and hardening nonlinearities at cryogenic temperatures.

The edge of silhouettes and motion are the most informative feature and previous studies have explored them separately and achieved notable results. However, due to occlusions and variations in viewing angles, their gait recognition performance is often affected by the predefined spatial segmentation strategy. Moreover, traditional temporal pooling usually neglects distinctive temporal information in gait. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel gait recognition framework, denoted as GaitASMS, which can effectively extract the adaptive structured spatial representations and naturally aggregate the multi-scale temporal information. The Adaptive Structured Representation Extraction Module (ASRE) separates the edge of silhouettes by using the adaptive edge mask and maximizes the representation in semantic latent space. Moreover, the Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation Module (MSTA) achieves effective modeling of long-short-range temporal information by temporally aggregated structure. Furthermore, we propose a new data augmentation, denoted random mask, to enrich the sample space of long-term occlusion and enhance the generalization of the model. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate the competitive advantage of proposed method, especially in complex scenes, i.e., BG and CL. On the CASIA-B dataset, GaitASMS achieves the average accuracy of 93.5% and outperforms the baseline on rank-1 accuracies by 3.4% and 6.3%, respectively, in BG and CL. The ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ASRE and MSTA. The source code is available at https://github.com/YanSun-github/GaitASMS.
